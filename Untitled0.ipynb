It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  Early mobilization within 24 hours of admission, in the form of early initiation of appropriate rehabilitation swivels or other nursing intervention, is advocated for the purpose of preventing complications related to immobility, including deep vein thrombosis, contractures, joint disorders, and pressure sores/decubitus ulcers. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated improved functional outcomes with mobilization in the first 24 hours following an acute stroke. These studies were both confounded by the duration of therapy for the intervention group receiving approximately 100 more minutes of therapy compared to the control group.\tNumber of patients who are mobilized from bed within 24 hours of admission\tNumber of patients presenting with symptoms of ischemic stroke (see the related \"Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions\" field)')"
