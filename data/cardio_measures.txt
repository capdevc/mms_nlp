This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who are referred to an appropriate cardiac rehabilitation program post-discharge - Phase Two Programs: electrocardiogram-monitored, outpatient, and Phase Three Programs: non-monitored, outpatient.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using cardiac rehabilitation.  Studies by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute estimate that each year approximately 785,000 Americans will have a new coronary attack and approximately 470,000 will have a recurrent attack.  Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention programs are recommended for patients diagnosed with ST-elevation or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Of particular concern are those patients who carry a moderate or high risk or have multiple modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease and for whom supervised exercise training is deemed appropriate. There is strong evidence to suggest that cardiac rehabilitation programs have been shown to decrease mortality rates in all populations, including younger, more selective populations, as well as the socioeconomically and clinically diverse older population (age 65 and older).  Phase Two Cardiac Rehabilitation  The U.S. Public Health Service described Phase Two cardiac rehabilitation as a "comprehensive, long-term program including medical evaluation, prescribed exercise, cardiac risk factor modification, education and counseling. Phase Two refers to outpatient, medically supervised programs that are typically initiated one to three weeks after hospital discharge and provide appropriate electrocardiographic monitoring." In the past, the main emphasis was exercise based, but today the focus includes risk factor modification, education and counseling.  Research shows that a cardiac rehabilitation program based on regular exercise and education focused on risk factor reduction is both efficient and effective in altering the course of coronary heart disease. The initial outpatient phase includes a comprehensive evaluation, education and treatment for outpatients who have experienced a cardiac-related event. Phase Two patients are monitored with continuous electrocardiogram, blood pressure, heart rate and subjective Rating of Perceived Exertion. For certain patients, referral to a Phase Two program may facilitate earlier hospital discharge by providing emotional support in the outpatient hospital setting.  Phase Three Cardiac Rehabilitation   Phase Three is a maintenance program based on the continuation of a heart healthy lifestyle. The program is designed for patients who have completed a Phase Two cardiac rehabilitation program or for individuals with a cardiac history or significant cardiac risk factors. Patients are not continually monitored by electrocardiogram, but spot-check electrocardiograms and daily blood pressures and heart rates are often recorded. Trained staff, when available, continues to provide support and education for risk factor modification and exercise progression. Warm-up, aerobic exercise, stretching and strength training (when appropriate) are included in Phase Three.

This measure* is used to assess the percent of patients 18 years of age and older with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke who were assessed for rehabilitation services.  *This is a Joint Commission only measure.Each year about 700,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke, which is the nation's third leading cause of death. Approximately two thirds of these individuals survive and require rehabilitation. Stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States, with about 4.4 million stroke survivors alive today. Forty percent of stroke patients are left with moderate functional impairment and 15 to 30 percent with severe disability. More than 60 percent of those who have experienced stroke, serious injury, or a disabling disease have never received rehabilitation. Stroke rehabilitation should begin as soon as the diagnosis of stroke is established and life-threatening problems are under control. Among the high priorities for stroke are to mobilize the patient and encourage resumption of self-care activities as soon as possible. A considerable body of evidence indicates better clinical outcomes when patients with stroke are treated in a setting that provides coordinated, multidisciplinary stroke-related evaluation and services. Effective rehabilitation interventions initiated early following stroke can enhance the recovery process and minimize functional disability. The primary goal of rehabilitation is to prevent complications, minimize impairments, and maximize function.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke who are not candidates for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment who receive aspirin within 24 hours of hospitalization, after a negative head computed tomography (CT), unless contraindicated.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and over receiving appropriate thrombolytic and appropriate antithrombotic therapy for ischemic stroke (tissue plasminogen activator [tPA] and aspirin, other antiplatelet agents, or an anticoagulant).  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  Although the benefits of aspirin therapy for long-term preventive therapy for stroke are well established, the use of aspirin to improve outcome in the acute treatment setting has also been demonstrated. Large randomized controlled trials have identified a small but measurable benefit with use of aspirin started within the first 48 hours following ischemic stroke onset. Number of patients not eligible for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients who were treated with aspirin within 24 hours of hospitalization, after a negative head computed tomography (CT), unless contraindicated
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of venous ulcer who were prescribed compression therapy within the 12 month reporting period.Compression therapy is fundamental to promote healing and prevent recurrence of ulcers in patients with venous abnormality. Although it has proven efficacy, research has shown that it is not universally used in the treatment of patients with venous ulcers. One study found that one third of patients did not receive compression of any sort and there was great variability in the level and type of compression therapy used. Graduated high compression (greater than 30 mmHg) produces the best results. However, some compression is better than no compression.  The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  For patients with venous hypertension or risk for venous insufficiency, consider graduated compression stockings. (American Society of Plastic Surgeons [ASPS], 2007)  The use of a Class 3 (most supportive) high-compression system (three layer, four layer, short stretch, paste-containing bandages, e.g., Unna's boot, Duke boot) is indicated in the treatment of venous ulcers. Although these modalities are similar in effectiveness, they can differ significantly in comfort and cost. The degree of compression must be modified when mixed venous/arterial disease is confirmed during the diagnostic work-up. Intermittent pneumatic pressure (IPC) can be used with or without compression dressings and can provide another option in patients who cannot or will not use a compression adequate dressing system. (Wound Healing Society [WHS], 2006)  Compression therapy heals more venous leg ulcers than no compression therapy as well as decreases the healing time. High compression is more effective than low compression, but there are no differences in the effectiveness of the different types of products available for high compression. (Wound, Ostomy, and Continence Nurses Society [WOCN], 2005)  Compression options        Elastic compression bandage heals more than inelastic compression       Multi-layer (2, 3, or 4 layers) sustained, elastic high-compression bandage       Elastic high-compression stockings to heal venous ulcers       Elastic multiple-layer high-compression stockings to heal venous ulcers       Duke Boot or Unna Boot + elastic compression       Gradient compression better than uniform compression       Short stretch bandage       Unna boot zinc paste impregnated bandage       Intermittent pneumatic compression       Non-elastic compression with Circaid [or similar device]       Sequential-gradient pneumatic compression (Association for the Advancement of Wound Care [AAWC], 2005)    All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of venous ulcer (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who were prescribed compression therapy within the 12 month reporting period    Note: Refer to the original measure documentation for administrative codes.
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients discharged from the critical care department with a main diagnosis of ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS) who died.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.   The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.  Although mortality from acute coronary syndrome (ACS) depends on many factors, it is associated with the levels of treatment that the patient receives, so we continue to consider this an indicator of the quality of care. Number of patients discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) with a main diagnosis of ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients discharged from the critical care department with a main diagnosis of ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS) who died (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure* estimates a hospital-level risk-standardized all-cause unplanned 30-day readmission for patients discharged from the hospital with a principal discharge diagnosis of heart failure (HF).  *This is a Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) only measure.The Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) developed the heart failure (HF) 30-day readmission measure to complement the existing HF process-of-care and mortality measures. Risk-standardized readmission rates (RSRRs) can provide important additional information about quality of care that is currently not captured by the process and mortality measures and is currently unavailable to hospitals. Variation in readmission, after adjusting for case-mix, may reflect differences in hospitals' general environments (such as coordination of care, patient safety policies, and staffing) or variation in care processes not measured in the current core measure set. Outcome measures can focus attention on a broader set of healthcare activities that affect patients' well-being. Moreover, improving outcomes is the ultimate goal of quality improvement, and thus the inclusion of outcomes measures assists in attaining improvement goals.  Readmission of patients who were recently discharged after hospitalization with HF represents an important, expensive, and often preventable adverse outcome. The risk of readmission can be modified by the quality and type of care provided to these patients. Improving readmission rates is the joint responsibility of hospitals and clinicians. Measuring readmission will create incentives to invest in interventions to improve hospital care, better assess the readiness of patients for discharge, and facilitate transitions to outpatient status. This measure is also responsive to the call by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to develop readmission measures, with HF highlighted as one of seven conditions that account for nearly 30% of potentially preventable readmissions in the 15-day window after initial hospital discharge (MedPAC, 2007). The measure cohort consists of admissions for Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) and Veterans Health Administration (VA) beneficiaries aged 65 years and older discharged from non-federal acute care hospitals or VA hospitals with a principal discharge diagnosis of heart failure (HF).  The risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" readmissions to the number of "expected" readmissions, multiplied by the national unadjusted readmission rate. The "denominator" is the number of readmissions expected on the basis of the nation's performance with that hospital's case-mix.  See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.  Note: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the measure cohort.  See the 2013 Measures Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-Standardized Readmission Measures for Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and Pneumonia for more details. The measure assesses unplanned readmissions to any acute care hospital within a 30-day period from the date of discharge from the index heart failure (HF) admission.  The hospital-specific risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" readmissions to the number of "expected" readmissions, multiplied by the national unadjusted readmission rate. The "numerator" of the ratio is the number of readmissions within 30 days predicted on the basis of the hospital's performance with its observed case-mix.  See the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.  Note: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the outcome.

Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Around 5.8 million people in the United States have heart failure (HF) and about 670,000 people are diagnosed with it each year. The most common causes of HF are coronary artery disease (CAD), high blood pressure, and diabetes. Since these are all treatable, controllable, precipitating conditions, HF may be prevented and/or controlled in an outpatient setting for the most part. However, the disease is also a chronic progressive disorder for which some hospitalizations are appropriate. Our literature review found some evidence of construct validity in that cardiologists have lower admission rates than general practitioners and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are under-prescribed. Admission rates for HF have been associated with lack of insurance, and access to care may account for as much as 60 percent of the variation in admission rates. As the causes for admissions may range from poor quality care, lack of patient compliance, or problems accessing care, areas may wish to review HF patient records to identify precipitating causes and potential targets for intervention.   HF admission rate is an avoidable hospitalization/ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC) indicator. These indicators are not measures of hospital quality, but rather measures of outpatient care and other healthcare not related to hospitalizations. These measures are of most interest to comprehensive health care delivery systems, such as some health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or public health agencies. ACSC indicators are correlated with each other and may be used in conjunction as an overall examination of outpatient care and access to care at a regional level.   Areas may wish to identify hospitals that contribute the most to the overall area rate for this indicator. The patient populations served by these hospitals may be a starting point for interventions.  Note: The following caveats affect the validity of the indicator:        Proxy: Indicator does not directly measure patient outcomes but an aspect of care that is associated with the outcome; thus, it is best used with other indicators that measure similar aspects of care. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.       Easily manipulated: Use of the indicator may create perverse incentives to improve performance on the indicator without truly improving quality of care. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.       Unclear benchmark: The "correct rate" has not been established for the indicator; national, regional, or peer group averages may be the best benchmark available. This concern has been demonstrated in the literature.    Discharges in the numerator are assigned to the denominator based on the Metro Area or county of the patient residence, not the Metro Area or county of the hospital where the discharge occurred (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All discharges of age 18 years and older with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) principal diagnosis code for heart failure (HF) (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke with paralysis or other reason for immobility receiving appropriate prevention for venous thromboembolism (VTE) (subcutaneous heparin or pneumatic compression device).The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of stroke patients age 18 years and over who receive appropriate medical management within the initial 24 to 48 hours of diagnosis for prevention of complications such as:        Dehydration       Aspiration       Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia       Deep vein thrombosis       Immobility       Falling       Nutritional status decline       Hyperthermia     Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  The evidence to support the prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in all patients with ischemic stroke in the acute phase is lacking. While a risk for DVT is high and prophylaxis may decrease the incidence, the risk for bleeding and bleeding events may outweigh outcome benefits. Clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits of starting injectable anticoagulants in ischemic stroke patients in the acute stroke phase and proceed with caution.   One may consider DVT prophylaxis in any patient admitted to the hospital with lower extremity weakness related to an ischemic stroke. The risk of DVT is high (25% to 50%), and prophylaxis with parenteral anticoagulant decreases the incidence (10% to 20%). The risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) appears to be decreased, as well, although numbers have been small and statistical significance not achieved.  All patients should receive patient education that includes signs and symptoms of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and therapy options, and encouraged to ambulate early and perform flexion/extension exercises. Thigh-length graduated elastic compression stockings have been shown in a randomized trial not to be effective in reducing risk of DVT after stroke. Interestingly, the same trialists found below-the-knee stockings to be inferior to thigh-length graduated elastic compression stockings, suggesting that the former may predispose to DVT. Intermittent pneumatic compression should be considered for patients at high risk for VTE who have contraindications to pharmacologic prophylaxis (see the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement [ICSI] Antithrombotic Therapy Supplement and ICSI Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis guideline). Number of patients presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke and paralysis or other reason for immobility (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients who have appropriate prevention for venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as subcutaneous heparin or pneumatic compression device
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with acute ischemic stroke who are mobilized from bed within 24 hours of admission.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of stroke patients age 18 years and over who receive appropriate medical management within the initial 24 to 48 hours of diagnosis for prevention of complications such as:        Dehydration       Aspiration       Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia       Deep vein thrombosis       Immobility       Falling       Nutritional status decline       Hyperthermia     Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  Early mobilization within 24 hours of admission, in the form of early initiation of appropriate rehabilitation swivels or other nursing intervention, is advocated for the purpose of preventing complications related to immobility, including deep vein thrombosis, contractures, joint disorders, and pressure sores/decubitus ulcers. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated improved functional outcomes with mobilization in the first 24 hours following an acute stroke. These studies were both confounded by the duration of therapy for the intervention group receiving approximately 100 more minutes of therapy compared to the control group.

Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),a relatively common procedure, that requires technical proficiency with the use of complex equipment. Technical errors may lead to clinically significant complications, such as abrupt coronary occlusion with or without myocardial infarction, emergency coronary bypass surgery, and death.   Our empirical analysis found a mean of 418 procedures per hospital per year. A substantial number of hospitals perform at least one procedure, but only a range of hospitals (42 percent to 69 percent) are considered high volume, depending on the threshold for hospital volume used. Higher volumes of PCI have been associated with better outcomes, namely fewer deaths and post-procedural coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG).   The volume-outcome relationship on which this indicator is based may not hold over time, as providers become more experienced or as technology changes. It is important then to revisit the volume-outcome relationship to ensure the validity of this indicator. Overall, volume measures are not direct measures of quality, and are relatively insensitive. For this reason they should be used with caution and in conjunction with measures of mortality and of quality of care within that field (in this case cardiac care), to ensure that increasing volumes truly improve patient outcomes.   It is unclear whether simply increasing volume at low volume hospitals would actually improve outcomes. It is possible that hospitals could increase volume simply by increasing the number of borderline or inappropriate procedures performed. For this reason, it may be prudent to examine this indicator alongside area rates for this procedure, and examinations of the appropriateness of the procedures.  Statewide hospital discharge data from California in 1989 demonstrated a significant association of mortality following PCI on admission day for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (p=0.0001). Timing of PCI relative to admission and age were predictors of mortality. Jollis et. al. examined PCI data from Medicare angioplasty patients from 1987 through 1990 and found a significant association between hospital PCI volume and mortality. Hospital volume was also associated with adverse outcomes (CABG after PCI or mortality) in California hospitals in 1989. Hospital volume was inversely associated with hospital morbidity (p0.001), length of stay (p=0.004) and average cost (p=0.0029).   Note: The following caveats affect the validity of this indicator:        Proxy: Indicator does not directly measure patient outcomes but an aspect of care that is associated with the outcome; thus, it is best used with other indicators that measure similar aspects of care. This concern has been demonstrated in the literature.       Selection bias: This results when a substantial percentage of care for a condition is provided in the outpatient setting, so the subset of inpatient cases may be unrepresentative. Examination of outpatient care or emergency care data may help to reduce this in these cases. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.       Easily manipulated: Use of the indicator may create perverse incentives to improve performance on the indicator without truly improving quality of care. This concern has been demonstrated in the literature.    This measure applies to providers of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (one provider at a time). Discharges, age 18 years and older, with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure code (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess percentage of patients age 18 years and older who were screened for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease who receive education and an intervention for modifiable risk factors.  Modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease need to be evaluated and may include smoking, inadequate physical activity, depression, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Intervention involving any risk factor pertinent to the patient is encouraged and may include education, goal setting, and follow-up as necessary. For all patients, lifestyle modification, including exercise, smoking cessation, achieving and maintaining ideal body weight, and proven risk factor reduction will continue to be the focus of primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention.  Depressive symptoms are common in patients with stable coronary artery disease, with prevalence estimates ranging from 15% to 30%. Depression can be triggered by a major cardiac event, and is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. It increases all-cause mortality and cardiac complications in patients with coronary artery disease. The American Heart Association recommends that depression be routinely screened for and appropriately treated in patients with coronary heart disease. A tool such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) can be useful to support the patient in processing the changes they are experiencing.  In The Heart and Soul Study, a prospective cohort study by Whooley, patients with depressive symptoms, defined as a PHQ-9 score of greater than or equal to 10, were significantly more likely to experience a cardiovascular event over a mean of 4.8 years. This difference was largely explained by behavioral factors, especially physical inactivity, that was greater in depressed patients.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of hypertensive patients age 18 and older with a blood pressure reading at clinician visit.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of hypertensive patients age 18 and older whose blood pressure is in control.  Approximately 30% of the adult population in the United States has hypertension. The majority of people over 65 years of age carry this diagnosis. Therefore, approximately 66.9 million people in the United States carry the diagnosis of hypertension. It is estimated that this number will rise as the number of patients who are over the age of 65, as well as the number of patients who are obese, continue to increase.  Hypertension is the most common reason for adult office visits other than pregnancy and has the highest use of prescription drugs. Despite the number of resources used to treat this disease, only about 50% of hypertensives have their blood pressure under control using the definition of blood pressure less than 140/90.  Poor adherence to lifestyle changes and medication contribute to this poor outcome. Lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, weight loss, increased exercise and limiting alcohol abuse are difficult when there are no symptoms of the disease until secondary problems arise. It is also difficult to continue medications when drug-related side effects arise when the disease itself is asymptomatic. Inadequate access to medical care for chronic disease, as well as the cost of medication, contribute to poor control of blood pressure. Number of patients age 18 years and older and with hypertension (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients age 18 years and older and with hypertension who have a blood pressure reading at clinician visit (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with venous thromboembolism (VTE) treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) who receive heparin treatment for at least five days after the initiation of warfarin therapy and until international normalized ratio (INR) is greater than or equal to 2.0 for two consecutive days. The priority aim addressed by this measure is to prevent progression or recurrence of thromboembolic disease.  It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year.  Heparin/fondaparinux should be continued for at least five days after the initiation of warfarin therapy and until international normalized ratio (INR) is greater than or equal to 2.0 for two consecutive days.  The anticoagulant effect of warfarin is delayed until clotting factors already circulating are cleared. Although Factor VII has a shorter half-life in the blood (six to seven hours), peak anticoagulant activity is delayed for up to 96 hours until factors with longer plasma half-lives (II, IX and X) have cleared.  A goal INR of 2.5 (range 2.0-3.0) is recommended for the treatment of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Number of patients age 18 years and older and with venous thromboembolism (VTE) treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)  Number of patients age 18 years and older and with venous thromboembolism (VTE) treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) who receive heparin treatment for at least five days after the initiation of warfarin therapy and until international normalized ratio (INR) is greater than or equal to 2.0 for two consecutive days
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with hypertension in whom the last blood pressure (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg or less.Hypertension is a common medical condition which is largely managed in primary care and represents a significant workload for general practitioners (GPs) and the primary care team. Trials of anti-hypertensive treatment have confirmed a significant reduction in the incidence of stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with treated hypertension.  This indicator measures the intermediate health outcome of a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg or less in patients with hypertension. Its intent is to promote the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) through satisfactory blood pressure control. This intermediate outcome can be achieved through lifestyle advice and the use of drug therapy.  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline on hypertension (2011) recommends drug therapy in patients who are aged 79 or under with stage 1 hypertension who have one or more of the following:        Target organ damage       Established CVD       Renal disease       Diabetes mellitus       A 10-year CVD risk equivalent to 20 per cent or greater     The NICE guideline recommends anti-hypertensive drug treatment for patients of any age with stage 2 hypertension.  The guideline recommends that a referral for specialist evaluation of secondary causes of hypertension and a more detailed assessment of potential target organ damage is considered for patients aged 39 or under with stage 1 hypertension and no evidence of target organ damage, CVD, renal disease or diabetes. This is because 10-year cardiovascular risk assessments can underestimate the lifetime risk of cardiovascular events in these patients.  The guideline also recommends that patients with hypertension have their care reviewed annually to monitor blood pressure, provide support and discuss lifestyle, symptoms and medication. However, the frequency of follow-up depends on factors such as the severity of hypertension, variability of blood pressure, complexity of the treatment regime, patient compliance and the need for non-pharmacological advice. For the purpose of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), a measurement of 150/90 mmHg has been adopted for this indicator.  Refer to the NICE guidance "Prevention of cardiovascular disease" (2010) for further information. Patients with hypertension (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator in whom the last blood pressure (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg or less
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Hypertension or high blood pressure is a chronic cardiac medical condition in which systemic arterial blood pressure is elevated. Hypertension is a common condition: 29.9 percent of US adults aged 18 years and older had high blood pressure in 2005 to 2008, and over 40 percent of the hypertensive population in the same time period did not have their blood pressure under control. However, hospitalizations for complications of hypertension are relatively uncommon. One study noted that hypertension accounted for only 0.5 percent of total admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC).   Hypertension is an avoidable hospitalization/ACSC indicator. These indicators are not measures of hospital quality, but rather measures of outpatient care and other healthcare not related to hospitalizations. These measures are of most interest to comprehensive health care delivery systems, such as some health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or public health agencies. ACSC indicators are correlated with each other and may be used in conjunction as an overall examination of outpatient care and access to care at a regional level.   Areas may wish to identify hospitals that contribute the most to the overall area rate for this indicator. The patient populations served by these hospitals may be a starting point for interventions. Areas may wish to examine the outpatient care for hypertension, as well as emergency room care, to identify potential processes of care that may reduce admission rates.   Note: The following caveats affect the validity of the indicator:        Proxy: Indicator does not directly measure patient outcomes but an aspect of care that is associated with the outcome; thus, it is best used with other indicators that measure similar aspects of care. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with venous thromboembolism (VTE) who are prescribed unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) who have appropriate laboratory tests (platelets, partial thromboplastin time [PTT] for those on UFH) available to monitor and adjust therapy.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to safely use anticoagulants to reduce the likelihood of patient harm and complications of anticoagulation therapy.  It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year.

The measure is used to assess the proportion of stroke patients in each risk-adjusted group, ages 16 years and older, that make at least one level of progress on the Problem Solving Functional Communication Measure (FCM).    The Problem Solving FCM is one of 15 FCM scales which are used to measure outcomes of speech and language therapy in the realm of swallowing and 14 areas of communication over time.  Each scale is composed of seven-point ratings ranging from least functional (level 1) to most functional (level 7).Changes in Functional Communication Measure (FCM) level provide information on the benefits of treatment designed to enhance functional communication and swallowing.  FCMs were designed to describe aspects of a patient's functional communication and swallowing abilities over time from admission to discharge in various speech-language pathology treatment settings. Stroke patients, ages 16 years and older, with a treatment plan recommending speech and language intervention for a minimum of two sessions. Patients must receive speech and language intervention using either an individual and/or group treatment model or a training and/or consultation model.

This measure* is used to assess the percent of ischemic stroke patients 18 years of age and older administered antithrombotic therapy by the end of hospital day 2.  *This is a Joint Commission only measure.The effectiveness of antithrombotic agents in reducing stroke mortality, stroke-related morbidity and recurrence rates has been studied in several large clinical trials. While the use of these agents for patients with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attacks continues to be the subject of study, substantial evidence is available from completed studies. Data at this time suggest that antithrombotic therapy should be initiated within 2 days of symptom onset in acute ischemic stroke patients to reduce stroke mortality and morbidity as long as no contraindications exist.    Anticoagulants at doses to prevent venous thromboembolism are insufficient antithrombotic therapy to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Ischemic stroke patients (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Ischemic stroke patients who had antithrombotic therapy administered by end of hospital day 2
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients, regardless of age, with an emergency department diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction who received fibrinolytic therapy and the fibrinolytic therapy was ordered by the physician within 20 minutes of performing the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).The time between the diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) to the administration of the fibrinolytic therapy is under the control of the emergency physician. Some time is needed to evaluate any contraindications, weigh the treatment options and obtain the informed consent.*  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  The delay from patient contact with the healthcare system (typically, arrival at the emergency department [ED] or contact with paramedics) to initiation of fibrinolytic therapy should be less than 30 minutes. (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association [ACC/AHA]) All patients, regardless of age, with an emergency department (ED) diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction who received fibrinolytic therapy (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients whose time from 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed to the time of fibrinolytic therapy is ordered is 20 minutes or less
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) who have had influenza immunisation in the preceding 1 August to 31 March.Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the developed world. One quarter of stroke deaths occur under the age of 65. There is evidence that appropriate diagnosis and management can improve outcomes.  While there have been no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) looking at the impact of flu vaccination specifically in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), there is evidence from observation studies that flu vaccination reduces risk of stroke (Lavallee et al., 2002; Nichol et al., 2003).  This is a current recommendation from the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Patients with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator who have had influenza immunisation in the preceding 1 August to 31 March
This measure is used to assess the percentage of venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients age 18 years and older who have a high clinical pretest probability (CPTP) (score greater than 6) for pulmonary embolism (PE) who received anticoagulation prior to diagnostic evaluation.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to prevent progression or recurrence of thromboembolic disease.  It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year. Number of venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients age 18 years and older who have a high clinical pretest probability (CPTP) for pulmonary embolism (PE) (score greater than 6) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients age 18 years and older who have a high clinical pretest probability (CPTP) for pulmonary embolism (PE) (score greater than 6) who receive anticoagulation prior to diagnostic evaluation
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke OR transient ischemic attack (TIA) who were prescribed antiplatelet therapy at discharge.    To promote a comprehensive approach to performance improvement, the Stroke and Stroke Rehabilitation Measurement Set is intended for use in its entirety when measuring clinical quality in the care of eligible patients. Full implementation of this measurement set for patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) should always include the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement measure, Radiology: Stenosis Measurement in Carotid Imaging Reports.Following a stroke, patients should be on antiplatelet therapy to decrease the risk of additional strokes.*  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  We recommend that every patient who has experienced a noncardioembolic (atherothrombotic, lacunar, or cryptogenic) stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and has no contraindication receives an antiplatelet agent regularly to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and other vascular events. Aspirin, 50 to 325 mg qd; the combination of aspirin, 25 mg, and extended-release dipyridamole, 200 mg bid; or clopidogrel, 75 mg qd, are all acceptable options for initial therapy. (American College of Chest Physicians [ACCP]) (Grade 1A)  For patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA, antiplatelet agents rather than oral anticoagulation are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular events. (American Stroke Association [ASA])  Aspirin (50 to 325 mg/d), the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, and clopidogrel are all acceptable options for initial therapy. (ASA) All patients aged 18 years and older with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke OR transient ischemic attack (TIA) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who were prescribed antiplatelet therapy at discharge (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of diabetes and foot ulcer who received education regarding appropriate foot care AND daily inspection of the feet within the 12 month reporting period.Educating diabetics about foot care has proven helpful in reducing foot ulcers and amputations, particularly in high risk patients. Nevertheless, studies have shown that diabetic patients are not offered adequate foot care. In one study examining several aspects of foot care in patients with diabetes, 28% of patients reported that they had not received foot education from their physician. Moreover, the presence of risk factors for lower limb complications was not associated with a greater chance of receiving foot education. The same study noted that patients who had received foot education and had their feet examined by their physician were more likely to perform self inspection. When combined with a comprehensive approach to preventive foot care, patient education can reduce the frequency and morbidity of limb threatening diabetic foot lesions."  The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  Good foot care and daily inspection of the feet will reduce the recurrence of diabetic ulceration. (Wound Healing Society [WHS], 2006)  Patient and family education assumes a primary role in prevention. Diabetic patients at risk for foot lesions must be educated about risk factors and the importance of foot care, including the need for self-inspection and surveillance, monitoring foot temperatures, appropriate daily foot hygiene, use of proper footwear, good diabetes control, and prompt recognition and professional treatment of newly discovered lesions. (Frykberg et al., American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons [ACFAS], 2006)  Educate the patient about the importance of optimizing glycemic control, using appropriate footwear at all times, avoiding foot trauma, performing daily self-examination of the feet, and reporting any changes to health care professionals. (Lipsky et al., Infectious Diseases Society of America [IDSA], 2004) All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of diabetes and foot ulcer    Note: Refer to the original measure documentation for administrative codes. Patients who received education regarding appropriate foot care AND daily inspection of the feet within the 12 month reporting period (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess whether the contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with peripheral arterial disease.Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is one of the three main categories of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and patients with PAD, including those who are asymptomatic, have an increased risk of mortality from CVD due to myocardial infarction and stroke. The relative risks of all-cause mortality are two to three times that of age and sex matched to groups without PAD.  Treatment of PAD focuses on cardiovascular risk factor management. Smoking is a very important risk factor for PAD and management of PAD includes smoking cessation (see smoking indicator set). Other established risk factors are high blood pressure and diabetes. This would mean that patients with PAD and high blood pressure would also be included in the hypertension indicator set and patients with diabetes and PAD would also be included in the diabetes indicator set.  The intent of the PAD indicators is to improve the identification and management of PAD and ensure all patients, including those without established risk factors already covered in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), are managed for their cardiovascular risk.  Refer to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline 147, "Lower limb peripheral arterial disease" (2012), for further information.  Patients with PAD may have symptoms, but can also be asymptomatic. About 20 per cent of patients aged 60 or over have PAD, although only a quarter of these patients have symptoms. Symptoms become severe and progressive in approximately 20 per cent of patients with symptomatic PAD.  Reduced ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) is an independent predictor of cardiac and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality and may help to identify patients who would benefit from secondary prevention.  The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guideline on the diagnosis and management of PAD (2006) states that a resting ABPI of 0.9 or under has been shown in several clinical studies to be up to 95 per cent sensitive in detecting angiogram positive disease and around 99 per cent specific in identifying supposedly healthy subjects. The guideline also states that there is no strict definition of what constitutes a normal ABPI. In practice, an ABPI of below 0.9 is considered to be abnormal. The ABPI of patients with intermittent claudication typically lies between 0.5 and 0.9. Imaging may be appropriate to exclude PAD when there is a discrepancy between clinical presentation and ABPI.  Establishing and maintaining disease registers is good professional practice and ensures a defined population is identified for undertaking further evidence-based interventions. Disease registers also make it possible to call and recall patients effectively to provide systematic care and to undertake care audits. This measure applies to contractors whose patient population includes individuals with a diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (one contractor at a time). The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with peripheral arterial disease.
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients ages 18 to 75 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with any of the following:      Glycated hemoglobin (HgbA1c) greater than 9%      Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and not on a statin      Established ASCVD and no documentation of daily aspirin use (unless contraindicated)      Blood pressure measurement greater than 160/100 mmHg      Currently smoke      Any of the above   This measure represents the composite rate. See the "Basis for Disaggregation" field for details.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to decrease the percentage of adult patients ages 18 to 75 with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with poorly controlled glucose and cardiovascular risk factors.  Due to the high percentage of the United States (U.S.) population that is diagnosed with diabetes and the effect diabetes has on other comorbidities, appropriate management will improve the patient's experience of care and the health of the population, reducing office visits, emergency department visits, and cardiovascular complications. Other related conditions will in turn reduce the total cost of care. Appropriate medication management targeting glycemic control, hypertension, and lipid management is important for reducing morbidity and mortality, and improving long-term quality of life for patients diagnosed with T2DM. Lifestyle changes such as nutrition therapy, weight loss, increased exercise, and appropriate education and self-management strategies are pivotal to improved outcomes. Inadequate access to care for chronic disease management as well as the cost of medication can contribute to poor control of T2DM and associated cardiovascular risk factors. For most chronic diseases, including diabetes, the most efficient improvement strategy is to focus on a limited number of specific improvement goals. These may be based on observed gaps in care, potential clinical impact, cost considerations or other criteria (O'Connor, 2005). In T2DM, focusing on glycemic control, lipid control and blood pressure control is a strategy that has been shown to be effective in preventing up to 53% of heart attacks and strokes, the leading drivers of excess mortality and costs in adults with diabetes (Gaede et al., 2003). Number of patients ages 18 to 75 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients with any of the following:      Glycated hemoglobin (HgbA1c) greater than 9%      Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and not on a statin      Established ASCVD and no documentation of daily aspirin use (unless contraindicated)      Blood pressure measurement greater than 160/100 mmHg      Currently smoke  
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 45 or over who have a record of blood pressure in the preceding 5 years.Detecting elevated blood pressure and, where indicated, treating it, is known to be an effective health intervention. Raised blood pressure is common if it is measured on a single occasion but with repeated measurement blood pressure tends to drop. Guideline recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension (National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions, 2006) are to be followed by practitioners when deciding on whether to treat raised blood pressure. The age limit of aged 45 or over has been chosen as the vast majority of patients develop hypertension after this age, this is also in line with the National Health Service (NHS) Health Checks Scheme. It is also to align the indicator more closely with the vascular checks programme and the cost-effectiveness modelling undertaken to support that programme. The age range 45 or over, coupled with a five year reference period, is designed to ensure that a blood pressure measurement takes place by the time someone reaches the age of 45. It is anticipated that contractors will opportunistically check blood pressures in all adult patients. Patients aged 45 or over (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)  Number of patients from the denominator who have a record of blood pressure in the preceding 5 years
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with any or any combination of the following conditions: coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), asthma, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder or other psychoses who are recorded as current smokers who have a record of an offer of support and treatment within the preceding 12 months.The aim of this domain is to increase the proportion of successful smoking quit attempts by providing the best available support and treatment. A wide range of diseases and conditions are caused by cigarette smoking, including cancers, respiratory diseases, coronary heart disease (CHD) and other circulatory diseases, stomach and duodenal ulcers, erectile dysfunction (ED) and infertility, osteoporosis, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration and periodontitis. Women who smoke during pregnancy are also at substantially higher risk of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) than those who do not smoke. Smoking can also cause complications in pregnancy and labour, including ectopic pregnancy, bleeding during pregnancy, premature detachment of the placenta and premature rupture of the membranes (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE], 2008). In 2011, 20 per cent of the adult population of Great Britain were cigarette smokers. The overall prevalence of smoking has been at approximately this level since 2007 (Office for National Statistics [ONS], 2011). Around 33 per cent of the population of England tried to stop in 2011, but only two to three per cent of the population succeed in stopping (West, 2011). Many of these attempts fail because they are made without treatment. There is good evidence to suggest that offering support and treatment is sufficient to motivate some smokers to attempt to stop who would not have done so with brief advice to quit alone. For example, a Cochrane review that included 132 trials of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), with over 40,000 people in the main analysis, found evidence that all forms of NRT made it more likely that a person's attempt to quit smoking would succeed. The chances of stopping smoking were increased by 50 to 70 per cent (Stead et al., 2008). National Health Service (NHS) Stop Smoking Services combine psychological support and medication. Results for April 2012 to March 2013 showed that 724,247 people who had contact with the service had set a quit date. Four weeks later, 373,872 people had successfully quit (based on self-report) representing half of those who set a quit date (The NHS Information Centre, 2013). 'An offer of support and treatment' means offering a referral or self-referral to a local NHS Stop Smoking Service adviser (who might be a member of the practice team) plus pharmacotherapy. Where such support is not acceptable to the patient, an alternative form of brief support, such as follow-up appointments with a general practitioner (GP) or practice nurse trained in smoking cessation, may be offered. The NICE public health guidance on smoking cessation (2008) states that healthcare professionals who advise on, or prescribe, NRT, varenicline or bupropion:      Offer NRT, varenicline or bupropion, as appropriate, to patients who are planning to stop smoking      Offer advice, encouragement and support, including referral to the NHS Stop Smoking Service, to help patients in their attempt to quit      When deciding which therapies to use and in which order, discuss the options with the client and take into account:              Whether a first offer of referral to the NHS Stop Smoking Service has been made          Contra-indications and the potential for adverse effects          The client's personal preferences          The availability of appropriate counselling or support          The likelihood that the client will follow the course of treatment          Their previous experience of smoking cessation aids             The guidance also states that managers and providers of NHS Stop Smoking Services:      Offer behavioural counselling, group therapy, pharmacotherapy, or a combination of treatments that have been proven to be effective      Ensure clients receive behavioural support from a person who has had training and supervision that complies with the "Standard for training in smoking cessation treatments" (Health Development Agency [HDA], 2003) or its updates      Provide tailored advice, counselling and support, particularly to clients from minority ethnic and disadvantaged groups      Provides services in the language chosen by clients, wherever possible.   NICE public health guidance also states that stop smoking advisers and other healthcare practitioners who advise on, supply, or prescribe, pharmacotherapies should encourage people who are already using an unlicensed nicotine-containing product (such as unlicensed electronic cigarettes) to switch to a licensed product (2013). Due to the potential for ex-smokers to resume smoking within three years of cessation, it is good clinical practice to ask patients with a history of smoking their current smoking status and offer treatment and advice where necessary. It is also good practice to ask and record the smoking status of newly registered patients and to offer support and treatment where necessary. Refer to NICE public health guidance 1, 10, 45 and 48 for more information. This indicator relates to patients who are on the disease registers for CHD, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), asthma and mental health who are recorded as current smokers. CHD Smoking is known to be associated with an increased risk of CHD. Refer to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) clinical guideline 97, "Risk estimation and the prevention of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (2007)," and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) European Guidelines "CVD Prevention in clinical practice (2007)," for further information. PAD PAD is associated with older age and with smoking. Cigarette smoking is a very important contributor to PAD and as such the management of PAD includes smoking cessation. Stroke or TIA There are few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the effects of risk factor modification in the secondary prevention of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. However, inferences can be drawn from the finds of primary prevention trials that cessation of cigarette smoking be advocated. Refer to SIGN clinical guideline 108, "Management of patients with stroke or TIA: assessment, investigation, immediate management and secondary prevention (2008)," for further information.  Hypertension There is no strong direct link between smoking and blood pressure. However, there is overwhelming evidence of the relationship between smoking and cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. The NICE clinical guideline on hypertension (2011) recommends that patients who smoke are offered advice and help to stop smoking. Diabetes The risk of vascular complications in patients with diabetes is substantially increased. Smoking is an established risk factor for cardiovascular and other diseases. COPD Smoking cessation is the single most effective and cost-effective intervention to reduce the risk of developing COPD and stop its progression. Refer to NICE clinical guideline 101, "Management of COPD in adults in primary and secondary care (2010)," and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Guidelines for further information. Asthma There are a surprisingly small number of studies on smoking related asthma. Starting smoking as a teenager increases the risk of persisting asthma. One controlled cohort study suggested that exposure to passive smoke at home delayed recovery from an acute attack. Smoking reduces the benefits of inhaled steroids and this adds further justification for recording this outcome (Tomlinson et al., 2005). There is also epidemiological evidence that smoking is associated with poor asthma control (Price et al., 2005). CKD There is good evidence from observational studies that patients with CKD are at increased cardiovascular risk and hence the rationale for including CKD here. Schizophrenia, Bipolar Affective Disorder or Other Psychoses Patients with a serious mental illness are far more likely to smoke than the general population (61 per cent of patients with schizophrenia and 46 per cent of patients with bipolar disorder smoke compared to 33 per cent of the general population). Premature death and smoking related diseases, such as respiratory disorders and heart disease, are however, more common among patients with serious mental illness who smoke than in the general population of smokers (McDonald, 2000). Patients with any or any combination of the following conditions: coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), asthma, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder or other psychoses who are recorded as current smokers (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator whose notes have a record of an offer of support and treatment within the preceding 12 months 
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Diabetes is the leading cause of lower extremity amputation (LEA) among adults in the U.S., with more than 60 percent of non-traumatic LEA occurring in people with diabetes. LEA is a common complication of diabetes, affecting up to 15 percent of all diabetics in their lifetimes. Infection, neuropathy and microvascular disease are among the precipitating factors leading to LEA. Proper long-term glucose control, diabetes education and foot care are some of the interventions that contribute to reduction in the incidence of these LEAs. Some observational studies have shown that high quality education and care can reduce LEA, though no studies have reported that low quality care is associated with increased LEA rates.   Within the diabetic community, the incidence of LEA has been reported as 375 per 100,000 person-years for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and 388 per 100,000 person-years for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The 25 year cumulative risk for LEA in both the NIDDM and IDDM populations was 11 percent. While the full etiology of factors leading to amputation are unknown, it is believed that a combination of factors contribute to the high rate of amputation in the diabetic population.   The admission rate for LEA in diabetics is an avoidable hospitalization/ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC) indicator. These indicators are not measures of hospital quality, but rather measures of outpatient care and other healthcare not related to hospitalizations. These measures are of most interest to comprehensive health care delivery systems, such as some health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or public health agencies. ACSC indicators are correlated with each other and may be used in conjunction as an overall examination of outpatient care and access to care at a regional level.   Areas may wish to identify hospitals that contribute the most to the overall area rate for this indicator. The patient populations served by these hospitals may be a starting point for interventions.  The Healthy People 2020 goal to reduce LEA rates is defined with a denominator of only diabetics. The proposed indicator has a denominator of total population, as data on diabetes rates in a population is not as readily available as census data. Nonetheless, areas with data on overall diabetes rates in the metropolitan area or county may wish to consider this indicator in context of these rates. Discharges in the numerator are assigned to the denominator based on the Metro Area or county of the patient residence, not the Metro Area or county of the hospital where the discharge occurred (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All discharges of age 18 years and older with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure code for lower-extremity amputation and diagnosis code of diabetes in any field (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the proportion of stroke patients in each risk-adjusted group, ages 16 years and older, that make at least one level of progress on the Spoken Language Comprehension Functional Communication Measure (FCM).

This measure is used to assess the number of patients diagnosed with confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) during hospitalization (not present at admission) who did not receive VTE prophylaxis between hospital admission and the day before the VTE diagnosis testing order date.The concept of "failure to prevent" has generated interest in national health policy organizations to identify evidence-based practice that will improve patient safety in the hospital setting (Shojania et al., 2001). The incidence of preventable venous thromboembolism (VTE) among hospitalized patients is overwhelming, and contributes to extended hospital stays, and the rising cost of health care. Zhan  Miller 2003 states that "VTE was the second most common medical complication of postoperative patients, the second most common cause of excess length of stay, and the third most common cause of excess mortality and excess charges." According to Arnold, Khan, and Shrier.(2001), preventable VTE is defined as "objectively diagnosed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary emboli (PE) that occurred in a setting in which thromboprophylaxis was indicated but was either administered inadequately or not administered at all." In spite of formal guidelines, and recommendations for preventative care, pulmonary embolism is still the most common preventable cause of death among hospitalized patients (Shojania et al., 2001). Patients who developed confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) during hospitalization (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who received no venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis prior to the VTE diagnostic test order date
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.This indicator measures how often patients died after developing a complication that should have been identified quickly and treated (also called failure to rescue). The underlying assumption is that good hospitals identify these complications quickly and treat them aggressively.  Among community hospitals in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, the risk-adjusted rate of this indicator was 12.61% in 2008. About 7,238 of these adverse events are estimated to have occurred in United States community hospitals in 2008. Compared to other Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs), the four year trend for this Quality Indicator (QI) showed consistent improvement in Veterans Affairs data from fiscal year (FY) 2001 through FY 2004, with a risk-adjusted rate of 12.93% in FY 2004.  All surgical discharges age 18 years and older or Major Diagnostic Category (MDC) 14 (pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium) defined by specific Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) or Medicare Severity-DRGs (MS-DRGs) and an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for an operating room procedure, principal procedure within 2 days of admission or admission type of elective (ATYPE=3) with potential complications of care listed in Death among Surgical definition (e.g., pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism [DVT/PE], sepsis, shock/cardiac arrest, or gastrointestinal [GI] hemorrhage/acute ulcer) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All discharges with a disposition of "deceased" (DISP=20) among cases meeting the inclusion and exclusion rules for the denominator
This measure is used to assess the percentage of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients age 18 years and olderwho receive a statin agent within 24 hours of arrival and at discharge from hospital for whom treatment is appropriate.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the timely initiation of treatment to reduce post-infarction mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).  Studies by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute estimate that each year approximately 785,000 Americans will have a new coronary attack and approximately 470,000 will have a recurrent attack.  Patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should be treated with statins. Statins may reduce recurrent ischemic event after ACS, all-cause mortality and revascularization. Patients should be started on statins regardless of baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Higher baseline LDL level at the time of ACS will draw more benefits from statin therapy than lower LDL levels. Most patients should be receiving a statin (or alternative lipid-lowering medication if intolerant to statins) at discharge from the hospital.

This measure is used to assess the percentage hypertensive patients age 18 years and older who receive education on the usage of non-pharmacological treatments.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of hypertensive patients age 18 and older who receive patient education, with a focus on the use of non-pharmacological treatments.  Approximately 30% of the adult population in the United States has hypertension. The majority of people over 65 years of age carry this diagnosis. Therefore, approximately 66.9 million people in the United States carry the diagnosis of hypertension. It is estimated that this number will rise as the number of patients who are over the age of 65, as well as the number of patients who are obese, continue to increase.  Hypertension is the most common reason for adult office visits other than pregnancy and has the highest use of prescription drugs. Despite the number of resources used to treat this disease, only about 50% of hypertensives have their blood pressure under control using the definition of blood pressure less than 140/90.  Poor adherence to lifestyle changes and medication contribute to this poor outcome. Lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, weight loss, increased exercise and limiting alcohol abuse are difficult when there are no symptoms of the disease until secondary problems arise. It is also difficult to continue medications when drug-related side effects arise when the disease itself is asymptomatic. Inadequate access to medical care for chronic disease, as well as the cost of medication, contribute to poor control of blood pressure.

Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a relatively common procedure. Our empirical analysis found a mean of 418 procedures per year. A substantial number of hospitals perform at least 1 procedure, but a range of hospitals (42 to 69 percent) are considered high volume, depending on the threshold for hospital volume used. In the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, 214 hospitals reported a mean of 382 PCIs per year in 1993 to 1994. The 27 percent of hospitals that were classified as low-volume (less than 200 per year) performed 5 percent of the procedures, whereas the 31 percent of hospitals classified as medium-volume (201 to 400 per year) performed 21 percent of the procedures and the 42 percent of hospitals classified as high-volume (greater than 400 per year) performed 74 percent of the procedures.   Higher volumes of PCI have been associated with better outcomes, namely fewer deaths and post-procedural coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (ACC/AHA/SCAI) have suggested that PCI be performed at hospitals performing at least 400 PCI procedures per year with an associated on-site cardiovascular surgical program by operators who perform at least 75 cases per year. This extends from the 1993 guidelines which indicated surgeons should perform the same number of cases per year, but institutions should perform at least 200 PCI specifically annually. Though many hospitals meet and exceed this rate, there are still hospitals that do not meet this guideline. PCI volume declined by 20 percent from 2006 to 2007 compared with a 56 percent increase in the previous decade.   It is expected that volume for PCI would be measured precisely using discharge abstract data. Though most procedures are performed on an inpatient basis, about 7 percent of procedures are performed on an outpatient basis. Providers may wish to examine outpatient and inpatient rates together.   The volume-outcome relationship on which this indicator is based may not hold over time, as providers become more experienced or as technology changes. It is important then to revisit the volume-outcome relationship to ensure the validity of this indicator. Overall, volume measures are not direct measures of quality, and are relatively insensitive. For this reason they should be used with caution and in conjunction with measures of mortality and of quality of care within that field (in this case cardiac care), to ensure that increasing volumes truly improve patient outcomes.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage who underwent a dysphagia screening process before taking any foods, fluids, or medication by mouth.  To promote a comprehensive approach to performance improvement, the Stroke and Stroke Rehabilitation Measurement Set is intended for use in its entirety when measuring clinical quality in the care of eligible patients. Full implementation of this measurement set for patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) should always include the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement measure, Radiology: Stenosis Measurement in Carotid Imaging Reports.All patients should have their swallowing evaluated prior to receiving food, fluids or oral medications to help prevent aspiration. The evaluation should be performed with a validated or hospital-approved dysphagia screening tool; a routine cranial nerve examination is not sufficient.*  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  Recommend that all patients have their swallow screened before initiating oral intake of fluids or food, utilizing a simple valid bedside testing protocol.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS) and primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and first medical contact (FMC)-balloon time less than 2 hours.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.   The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.  Primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is the treatment of choice for ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS) provided it is done early by an experienced team. The recommended time from first medical contact (FMC) to balloon dilation is less than 2 hours in all cases and less than 90 minutes in patients that reach the hospital soon after an extensive infarct.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with peripheral arterial disease with a record in the preceding 12 months that aspirin or an alternative anti-platelet is being taken.Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is one of the three main categories of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and patients with PAD, including those who are asymptomatic, have an increased risk of mortality from CVD due to myocardial infarction and stroke. The relative risks of all-cause mortality are two to three times that of age and sex matched to groups without PAD.  Treatment of PAD focuses on cardiovascular risk factor management. Smoking is a very important risk factor for PAD and management of PAD includes smoking cessation (see smoking indicator set). Other established risk factors are high blood pressure and diabetes. This would mean that patients with PAD and high blood pressure would also be included in the hypertension indicator set and patients with diabetes and PAD would also be included in the diabetes indicator set.  The intent of the PAD indicators is to improve the identification and management of PAD and ensure all patients, including those without established risk factors already covered in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), are managed for their cardiovascular risk.  Refer to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline 147, "Lower limb peripheral arterial disease" (2012), for further information.  Most cases of PAD are managed in primary care. The focus of management is on the secondary prevention of CVD. It is important to reduce the cardiovascular complications of atherosclerosis through appropriate cardiovascular risk factor management. Two small UK studies assessing clinical risk management based on the patient records of patients with PAD (Bradley  Kirker, 2006; Khan et al., 2007) suggest that these patients have poor hypertension control, use low levels of statin and anti-platelet therapy, and receive low levels of smoking cessation advice. This indicator addresses the issue of prescribing anti-platelet therapy.  The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) clinical guideline on PAD (2006) states that anti-platelet therapy is recommended for patients with symptomatic PAD.  The Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration (ATC) meta-analysis (2002) showed a 23 per cent reduction in serious vascular events in a subgroup of 9214 people with PAD who were treated with anti-platelet drugs. Similar results were found in a second systematic review of the effects of anti-platelet therapy in patients with PAD (NICE, 2010). When comparing the effects of different anti-platelet drugs, the ATC found no evidence of statistically significant differences between anti-platelets. Patients with peripheral arterial disease (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator with a record in the preceding 12 months that aspirin or an alternative anti-platelet is being taken (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is a technically difficult, yet relatively common procedure. The frequency of CABG has been relatively stable over the past 15 years, as percutaneous coronary interventions have become more popular. Approximately 366,000 CABG were performed in the USA in 1997 (13.5 per 10,000 persons). Approximately 427,000 CABG were performed in the USA in 2004 (14.6 per 10,000 persons). States (CA, MA, NJ, NY, PA) which publish hospital-specific report cards for CABG performed significantly fewer (p=0.05) procedures (113.8  31.8 per million capita) than non-reporting states (152  62.6 per million capita).  CABG was included in the Health Cost and Utilization Project Inpatient Quality Indicators (HCUP IQI) as a provider-level indicator and a potentially overused procedure. In this report this indicator has been redefined as an area-level indicator. Substantial and systematic small area variation has been noted in the literature. This variation is not explained by sociodemographic characteristics.   Area rates are based on the rates for hospitals within an area, and as such do not take into account that some patients are referred into area hospitals from a different area. Examination of data containing patient residence may aid in identifying the extent to which patients are referred into an area. HCUP data may also be used to examine which hospitals contribute the most to the overall area rate.   Note: As an area utilization indicator, CABG is a proxy for actual quality problems. This indicator in particular has unclear construct validity, because CABG does not appear to be performed inappropriately often. Caution should be maintained for CABG rates that are drastically below or above the average or recommended rates.  The following caveats affect the validity of the indicator:        Proxy: Indicator does not directly measure patient outcomes but an aspect of care that is associated with the outcome; thus, it is best used with other indicators that measure similar aspects of care.       Unclear construct: There is uncertainty or poor correlation with widely accepted process measures.       Unclear benchmark: The "correct rate" has not been established for the indicator; national, regional, or peer group averages may be the best benchmark available.    Discharges in the numerator are assigned to the denominator based on the Metro Area or county of the patient residence, not the Metro Area or county of the hospital where the discharge occurred (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of discharges with a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure age 40 years and older (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients in the healthcare system's cardiac rehabilitation program(s) who meet the specified performance measure criteria for tobacco use.  This performance measure is one of ten individual submeasures of the measure subset, Individualized Patient Assessment and Evaluation of Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Development of Individual Interventions, and Communication with Other Healthcare Providers.Cessation of tobacco use is most successful when healthcare providers work together with patients to identify and implement effective treatment strategies. Persons with cardiovascular disease (CVD) who stop smoking reduce their cardiovascular risk by approximately 35%.

This measure* is used to assess the percent of patients 18 years of age and older with both an ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation/flutter who are prescribed anticoagulation therapy at hospital discharge.  *This is a Joint Commission only measure.Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is a common arrhythmia and an important risk factor for stroke. It is one of several conditions and lifestyle factors that have been identified as risk factors for stroke. It has been estimated that over 2 million adults in the United States have NVAF. While the median age of patients with atrial fibrillation is 75 years, the incidence increases with advancing age. For example, the Framingham Heart Study noted a dramatic increase in stroke risk associated with atrial fibrillation with advancing age, from 1.5% for those 50 to 59 years of age to 23.5% for those 80 to 89 years of age. Furthermore, a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are among a limited number of predictors of high stroke risk within the population of patients with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, much emphasis has been placed on identifying methods for preventing recurrent ischemic stroke as well as preventing first stroke. Prevention strategies focus on the modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, and atrial fibrillation. Analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy of warfarin in the primary prevention of thromboembolic stroke, found the relative risk of thromboembolic stroke was reduced by 68% for atrial fibrillation patients treated with warfarin. The administration of anticoagulant therapy, unless there are contraindications, is an established effective strategy in preventing recurrent stroke in high stroke risk-atrial fibrillation patients with TIA or prior stroke. Ischemic stroke patients with documented atrial fibrillation/flutter (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Ischemic stroke patients prescribed anticoagulation therapy at hospital discharge
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients undergoing a total knee replacement who are evaluated for the presence or absence of cardiovascular risk factors within 30 days prior to the procedure including history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmia, and stroke.Prior to a total knee replacement the patient's venous thromboembolic and cardiovascular risk should be evaluated. A population-based study of all Olmstead County, Minnesota, patients undergoing a total hip or knee arthroplasty from 1994 to 2008, reported that patients undergoing a total knee arthroplasty with a previous history of a cardiac event or a thromboembolic event were associated with an increased risk of a 90-day cardiac or thromboembolic event following surgery (Singh et al., 2011).  A study using the Danish national resident registries compared all patients undergoing a primary total hip replacement and total knee replacement from 1998 to 2007 to control groups not undergoing one of the procedures and found that the acute myocardial infarction rate 2 weeks after total knee replacement was increased 31-fold compared to the control group (Lalmohamed et al., 2012).  Any preoperative disease state should be identified and managed prior to surgery to minimize the risk of the surgical procedure.  SooHoo and colleagues found that the cardiovascular evaluation was performed 40 percent of the time at the 3 California hospitals with the rates ranging from 15 to 59 percent (SooHoo et al., 2011).  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines:  In patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) or the new onset of signs or symptoms suggestive of CAD, baseline cardiac assessment should be performed. In the asymptomatic patient, a more extensive assessment of history and physical is warranted in those individuals 50 years of age or older, because the evidence related to the determination of cardiac risk factors and derivation of a Revised Cardiac Risk Index occurred in this population. Preoperative cardiac evaluation must therefore be carefully tailored to the circumstances that have prompted the evaluation and to the nature of the surgical illness (Fleisher et al., 2007). All patients undergoing a total knee replacement (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who were evaluated for the presence or absence of cardiovascular risk factors within 30 days prior to the procedure including history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmia and stroke
This measure is used to assess the age-standardized rate of new acute myocardial infarction (AMI) events admitted to an acute care hospital per 100,000 population age 20 and over. A new event is defined as a first-ever hospitalization for an AMI or a recurrent hospitalized AMI occurring more than 28 days after the admission for the previous event in the reference period.Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and death. Measuring its occurrence in the population is important for planning and evaluating preventive strategies, allocating health resources and estimating costs. From a disease surveillance perspective, there are three groups of AMI events: non-diagnosed events, fatal events occurring outside the hospital and those admitted to acute care hospitals. Although AMIs admitted to a hospital do not reflect all AMIs in the community, this information provides a useful and timely estimate of the disease occurrence in the population.

The measure is used to assess the proportion of stroke patients in each risk-adjusted group, ages 16 years and older, that make at least one level of progress on the Motor Speech Functional Communication Measure (FCM).    The Motor Speech FCM is one of 15 FCM scales which are used to measure outcomes of speech and language therapy in the realm of swallowing and 14 areas of communication over time.  Each scale is composed of seven-point ratings ranging from least functional (level 1) to most functional (level 7).Changes in Functional Communication Measure (FCM) level provide information on the benefits of treatment designed to enhance functional communication and swallowing.  FCMs were designed to describe aspects of a patient's functional communication and swallowing abilities over time from admission to discharge in various speech-language pathology treatment settings. Stroke patients, ages 16 years and older, with a treatment plan recommending speech and language intervention for a minimum of two sessions. Patients must receive speech and language intervention using either an individual and/or group treatment model or a training and/or consultation model.

This measure is used to assess the mean therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) range (TTR) achieved among patients who received prescriptions for warfarin and had sufficient INR values to calculate TTR.Millions of patients in the United States use warfarin to prevent strokes or to prevent or treat venous thromboembolism. Warfarin is highly effective, and has been in clinical use for over 50 years. However, warfarin is difficult to manage because it has many possible interactions with diet, other drugs, and comorbid conditions that may destabilize anticoagulation control. The possible consequences of insufficient or excessive anticoagulation are extremely serious and often fatal, making it imperative to pursue good control.  The international normalized ratio (INR) test is the laboratory test used to determine the degree to which the patient's coagulation has been successfully suppressed by the vitamin K antagonist (VKA). For most patients, the goal is to keep the INR between 2 and 3, which roughly corresponds to the blood taking 2 to 3 times as long to clot as would a normal person's blood. This level of anticoagulation has been shown to maximize benefit (i.e., protect patients from blood clots) while minimizing risk (i.e., risk of hemorrhage attributable to excessive anticoagulation). Therapeutic INR range (TTR) is a way of summarizing INR control over time.  TTR has been followed before, mostly in the setting of clinical trials where it is used to evaluate the effectiveness of warfarin therapy, particularly when warfarin is being compared to some other strategy. However, TTR has not previously been used as a quality measure  in fact, there has been a general lack of quality measurement in oral anticoagulation. There is much evidence that better anticoagulation control (i.e., higher TTR) can protect patients from severe or even fatal adverse events. All patients, 18 years and older, who received prescriptions for warfarin and had sufficient international normalized ratio (INR) values to calculate therapeutic INR range (TTR) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Mean therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) range (TTR) achieved among patients who received prescriptions for warfarin and had sufficient INR values to calculate TTR
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with documentation in the medical record that a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was obtained within the last 12 months with an LDL less than 100 mg/dL. Consider less than 70 mg/dL for high-risk patients.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease who receive education and an intervention for modifiable risk factors.  Modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease need to be evaluated and may include smoking, inadequate physical activity, depression, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Intervention involving any risk factor pertinent to the patient is encouraged and may include education, goal setting, and follow-up as necessary. For all patients, lifestyle modification, including exercise, smoking cessation, achieving and maintaining ideal body weight, and proven risk factor reduction will continue to be the focus of primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention.  A fasting lipid profile should be evaluated for appropriate patients with stable coronary artery disease. Secondary prevention is important in these patients, who should be treated aggressively for hyperlipidemia. Many patients will require both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions to reach target goals. Target goals for hyperlipidemic patients with coronary artery disease include:        Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  less than 100 mg/dL for all patients, ideal less than 70 mg/dL especially for high-risk patients       High-density lipoprotein (HDL)  40 mg/dL or greater       Triglycerides  less than 150 mg/dL    Number of stable coronary artery disease patients (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of stable coronary artery disease patients who had low-density lipoprotein (LDL) screening within the last 12 months and LDL was less than 100 mg/dL (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with diabetes with a documented glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of less than 7.0% or meeting the patient's individualized HbA1c goal.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease who receive education and an intervention for modifiable risk factors.  Modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease need to be evaluated and may include smoking, inadequate physical activity, depression, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Intervention involving any risk factor pertinent to the patient is encouraged and may include education, goal setting, and follow-up as necessary. For all patients, lifestyle modification, including exercise, smoking cessation, achieving and maintaining ideal body weight, and proven risk factor reduction will continue to be the focus of primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention.  Diabetes is associated with a marked increase in coronary artery disease. Patients with diabetes without known coronary artery disease have as high risk of a myocardial infarction as patients without diabetes with coronary artery disease. Therefore, patients with diabetes should have aggressive lipid and blood pressure management (similar to patients with coronary artery disease), and should be treated per the recommendations of the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) Diagnosis and Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Adults guideline, ICSI Lipid Management in Adults guideline and ICSI Hypertension Diagnosis and Treatment guidelines.  Every attempt should be made to achieve meticulous glucose control in patients with diabetes, because there is a clear relationship between lower hemoglobin A1c's and lower risk of myocardial infarction. In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), obese patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with metformin showed a statistically significant reduction in rates of myocardial infarction, suggesting metformin as a possible therapy of choice for these patients. A meta-analysis showed a 20% increase in cardiovascular events and mortality for every 1% increase in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) over 5%. Number of stable coronary artery disease patients with diabetes (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of stable coronary artery disease patients who had a documented glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of less than 7% or who met their individualized goal
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who were evaluated for proper footwear and sizing during one or more office visits within 12 months.Foot ulceration is the most common single precursor to lower extremity amputations among persons with diabetes.  Shoe trauma, in concert with loss of protective sensation and concomitant foot deformity, is the leading event precipitating foot ulceration in persons with diabetes.  Treatment of infected foot wounds accounts for up to one-quarter of all inpatient hospital admissions for people with diabetes in the United States.  Peripheral sensory neuropathy in the absence of perceived trauma is the primary factor leading to diabetic foot ulcerations.  Approximately 45-60% of all diabetic ulcerations are purely neuropathic. In people with diabetes, 22.8% have foot problems -- such as amputations and numbness -- compared with 10% of nondiabetics.  Over the age of 40 years old, 30% of people with diabetes have loss of sensation in their feet.    CLINCAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS:    The multifactorial etiology of diabetic foot ulcers is evidenced by the numerous pathophysiologic pathways that can potentially lead to this disorder. Among these are two common mechanisms by which foot deformity and neuropathy may induce skin breakdown in persons with diabetes. The first mechanism of injury refers to prolonged low pressure over a bony prominence (i.e., bunion or hammertoe deformity). This generally causes wounds over the medial, lateral, and dorsal aspects of the forefoot and is associated with tight or ill-fitting shoes.  The other common mechanism of ulceration involves prolonged repetitive moderate stress.  This normally occurs on the sole of the foot and is related to prominent metatarsal heads, atrophied or anteriorly displaced fat pads, structural deformity of the lower extremity, and prolonged walking.

This measure is used to access the percent of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older who are prescribed a statin at hospital discharge.Several randomized clinical trials have proven the benefits of statin drugs (also known as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A [HMG Co-A] reductase inhibitors) in reducing the risk of death and recurrent cardiovascular events in a broad range of patients with established cardiovascular disease, including those with prior myocardial infarction (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study Group, 1994; Sacks et al., 1996; The Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease [LIPID] Study Group, 1998; Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group, 2002). Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines place a strong emphasis on the initiation or maintenance of statin drugs for patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), particularly those with low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels above 100 mg/dL (Smith et al., 2011; Anderson et al., 2007; American College of Emergency Physicianset al., 2013). As a result of the strength of the evidence and guideline support, the ACC/AHA have developed a performance measure to assess this aspect of care for patients with acute myocardial infarction (Krumholz et al., 2008). Because statins are generally well-tolerated, most patients with AMI are appropriate candidates for this therapy.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients in the health care system's cardiac rehabilitation program(s) who meet the specified performance measure criteria for diabetes mellitus or impaired fasting glucose.  This performance measure is one of ten individual submeasures of the measure subset, Individualized Patient Assessment and Evaluation of Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Development of Individual Interventions, and Communication with Other Healthcare Providers.The presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG) has been linked to unfavorable long-term cardiovascular outcomes. Because improved glycemic control has been shown to favorably affect cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program setting is an ideal environment to educate patients about the implications of DM or IFG and to initiate the behavior patterns that foster improved glycemic control. Number of patients in the healthcare system's cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program(s) Number of patients in the healthcare system's cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program(s) who meet the performance measure for diabetes mellitus/impaired fasting glucose (DM/IFG) (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure* is used to assess the percent of patients 18 years of age and older hospitalized with ischemic stroke who are prescribed antithrombotic therapy at hospital discharge.  This is a Joint Commission only measure.The effectiveness of antithrombotic agents in reducing stroke mortality, stroke-related morbidity and recurrence rates has been studied in several large clinical trials. While the use of these agents for patients with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attacks continues to be the subject of study, substantial evidence is available from completed studies. Data at this time suggest that antithrombotic therapy should be prescribed at discharge following acute ischemic stroke to reduce stroke mortality and morbidity as long as no contraindications exist. For patients with a stroke due to a cardioembolic source (e.g., atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valve), warfarin is recommended unless contraindicated. Warfarin is not generally recommended for secondary stroke prevention in patients presumed to have a non-cardioembolic stroke.    Anticoagulants at doses to prevent deep vein thrombosis are insufficient antithrombotic therapy to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

This measure is used to assess the risk-adjusted rate of urgent readmission within 30 days following discharge for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for individuals age 20 years and older. Non-elective return to an acute care hospital for any cause is counted as a readmission if it occurs within 30 days of discharge from the index episode of inpatient care. An episode of care refers to all contiguous inpatient hospitalizations and same-day surgery visits.Heart attack, or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), is one of the leading causes of death in Canada. About 18,000 Canadians die as a result of heart attacks every year. Heart attacks are life-threatening emergencies that happen when the coronary arteriesthe blood vessels supplying blood to the heart muscle to keep it workingare suddenly blocked. Lack of blood damages the heart muscle, weakening its function or stopping it altogether, which can be fatal.  Readmission rates provide one measure of quality of care. The risk of readmission following an AMI may be related to the type of drugs prescribed at discharge, patient compliance with post-discharge therapy, the quality of follow-up care in the community, or the availability of appropriate diagnostic or therapeutic technologies during the initial hospital stay. Although readmission for medical conditions may involve factors outside the direct control of the hospital, high rates of readmission act as a signal to hospitals to look more carefully at their practices, including the risk of discharging patients too early and the relationship with community physicians and community-based care.  Readmissions to acute care facilities are increasingly being used to measure institutional or regional quality of care and care coordination. Readmission rates after AMI can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the quality of inpatient and outpatient care, effectiveness of the care transition and coordination, or the availability of appropriate diagnostic or therapeutic technologies during the initial hospital stay. While not all urgent readmissions are avoidable, interventions during and after a hospitalization can be effective in reducing readmission rates. Total number of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) episodes in an 11-month period (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of cases within the denominator with an urgent readmission within 30 days of discharge in the reference period (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure* is used to assess the percent of patients 18 years of age and older with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, or their caregivers, who were given educational materials during the hospital stay addressing all of the following:        Activation of emergency medical system       Follow-up after discharge       Medications prescribed at discharge       Risk factors for stroke       Warning signs and symptoms of stroke     *This is a Joint Commission only measure.There are many examples of how patient education programs for specific chronic conditions have increased healthful behaviors, improved health status, and/or decreased health care costs of their participants. Clinical practice guidelines include recommendations for patient and family education during hospitalization as well as information about resources for social support services. Some clinical trials have shown measurable benefits in patient and caregiver outcomes with the application of education and support strategies. The type of stroke experienced and the resulting outcomes will play a large role in determining not only the course of treatment but also what education will be required. Patient education should include information about the event (e.g., cause, treatment, and risk factors), the role of various medications or strategies, as well as desirable lifestyle modifications to reduce risk or improve outcomes. Family/caregivers will also need guidance in planning effective and realistic care strategies appropriate to the patient's prognosis and potential for rehabilitation. Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients discharged home (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients with documentation that they or their caregivers were given educational material addressing all of the following:        Activation of emergency medical system       Follow-up after discharge       Medications prescribed at discharge       Risk factors for stroke       Warning signs and symptoms of stroke  
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients 18 years and older who were dispensed at least one prescription for an oral hypoglycemic agent, insulin, incretin mimetics and at least one prescription for an antihypertensive agent who receive an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)/direct renin inhibitor or ACEI/ARB/direct renin inhibitor combination during the measurement year.Hypertension is a significant risk factor for patients with diabetes mellitus. The choice of antihypertensive agents in diabetic patients is based upon the ability of certain drugs to prevent adverse cardio-vascular events and to slow progression of renal disease, if present. Patients 18 years and older who were dispensed at least one prescription for an oral hypoglycemic agent, insulin, incretin mimetics and at least one prescription for an antihypertensive agent during the measurement year (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) The number of patients who receive an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)/direct renin inhibitor or ACEI/ARB/direct renin inhibitor combination during the measurement year (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) undergoing cerebral angiography within 48 hours.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.  The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.  Current trends favor early exclusion of the aneurysm in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) to reduce the rate of rebleeding, which is highest in the first days of SAH. Early exclusion of the aneurysm helps prevent severe complications. Number of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) admitted to critical care (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) undergoing cerebral angiography within 48 hours (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of eligible patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke who receive tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) according to guideline.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and over receiving appropriate thrombolytic and appropriate antithrombotic therapy for ischemic stroke (tissue plasminogen activator [tPA] and aspirin, other antiplatelet agents, or an anticoagulant).  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  Patients presenting to the emergency department soon after the onset of symptoms may be candidates for treatment with intravenous (IV) tPA and will therefore require a rapid evaluation and treatment initiation.  A qualified clinician (i.e., trained and experienced in acute stroke management or supported via telemedicine arrangement by such a clinician) should administer IV tPA to selected and qualifying patients with acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset or of time last known to be at their baselines in appropriate care circumstances (i.e., in a "stroke-ready" emergency department or hospital).  Stakes are high, impact of treatment is substantial, and evidence is strong for treatment of appropriately selected patients. Number of patients eligible for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment and treated with tPA (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients who were treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) according to guideline (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients 18 years and older with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) who have been assessed for the need for graduated compression stockings (not T.E.D.sTM).The priority aim addressed by this measure is to prevent progression or recurrence of thromboembolic disease.  It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year.  For DVT, graduated compression stockings should be used, at least 30 to 40 mm Hg (not T.E.D.sTM stockings), on the affected leg to reduce the risk of post-phlebitic syndrome.  Graduated compression stockings combined with early ambulation do not cause any increase in PE and give more rapid resolution of pain and swelling. A study of 638 consecutive patients with DVT who were allowed to ambulate showed a low incidence of ventilation/perfusion scan-documented PE compared with that reported in the literature, suggesting no increased risk from early ambulation. Number of patients age 18 years and older and diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) Number of patients age 18 years and older and diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) who have been assessed for the need for graduated compression stockings (not T.E.D.sTM)
This measure is used to assess the relative resource use by members with cardiovascular conditions by reporting total standard cost and service frequency for all services for which the organization has paid or expects to pay during the measurement year.   Note: Organizations must report the Cholesterol Management for Patients with Cardiovascular Conditions (CMC) and Persistence of Beta-blocker Treatment After a Heart Attack (PBH) quality measures when reporting Relative Resource Use for People with Cardiovascular Conditions (RCA).  Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC): Measure specifications reference value sets that must be used for HEDIS reporting. In this NQMC measure summary, value set references are capitalized and underlined. A value set is the complete set of codes used to identify the service or condition included in the measure. Refer to the original measure documentation for the Value Set Directory. How much care costs is an important consideration when choosing a health plan. There is a great demand for information to help purchasers and consumers determine which organizations offer the highest quality services, along with effective management of those services and low premium or out-of-pocket costs.  HEDIS 2014 includes five measures of relative resource use (RRU) for members with specific chronic and acute conditions: diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma.  The measures are a standardized approach to measuring resource use. When evaluated with the corresponding Quality of Care measures, they provide more information about the efficiency or value of services rendered by an organization. Members age 18 to 75 years as of December 31 of the measurement year who were discharged alive for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the year prior to the measurement year, or who had a diagnosis of ischemic vascular disease (IVD) during measurement year and the year prior to the measurement year (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Total standard cost and service frequency counts for all services for which the organization has paid or expects to pay for the eligible population during the treatment period, reported by age, gender and risk group (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older diagnosed with lower extremity venous thromboembolism (VTE) who meet the criteria for low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and for whom shared decision-making was used prior to implementing therapy.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to improve accurate diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE).  It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE) and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year.  Treatment for VTE with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) provides reliable anticoagulation levels when given subcutaneously on a weight-based dosing schedule. No laboratory monitoring of the intensity of anticoagulation is required for LMWH, except in special circumstances. Recent randomized controlled trials of the treatment of PE have shown LMWH to be as effective and safe as unfractionated heparin (UFH).  Patient-focused care would include shared-decision making between patient, family and the clinician when deciding upon outpatient treatment. According to the MN Shared Decision-Making Collaborative: shared decision-making is a process in which patients and clinicians collaborate to clarify all acceptable options, ensure the patient is well-informed, and choose a course of care consistent with patient values and preferences and the best available medical evidence. Patients diagnosed with lower extremity venous thromboembolism (VTE) as identified by the following International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes: 451.11, 451.19, 451.2, 453.8, who meet the criteria for low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (listed with Generic Code Number [GCN] code 7542) for whom shared decision-making was used prior to therapy selection
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12 month period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge.  Note: This measure and the Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) Therapy for Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction measure (see the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse [NQMC] summary Heart failure: percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% who were prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy either within a 12 month period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge address related aspects of care for effective treatment for patients with heart failure and should be measured concurrently. Both ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce mortality and hospitalizations and improve a patient's clinical status. ARBs can be considered a reasonable alternative for ACE inhibitors. Combined treatment with these agents produces additive benefits and is required for optimal management of heart failure. It is not recommended that either of these measures be used independently. The pairing of these measures is not intended to suggest the use of any particular scoring methodology (i.e., a composite score), nor does it imply either equality of or difference in the relative "weights" of the two measures. A performance score for each measure should be reported individually to provide actionable information upon which to focus quality improvement efforts.  The National Quality Forum (NQF) provides definitions of paired and composite measures:        Paired measures are individual measures that should be measured concurrently in the same population; however, the results are not combined into a single score (e.g., measuring mortality and readmission and displaying them togetherbut not calculating a joint score).       A composite measure is a combination of two or more individual measures in a single measure that results in a single score.   Heart failure is a chronic condition that poses a major and growing threat to the public's health. Improving the effectiveness of care and optimizing patient outcomes will become increasingly important as the population of the United States ages.  Beta-blockers are recommended for all patients with stable heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, unless contraindicated. Treatment should be initiated as soon as a patient is diagnosed with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and does not have low blood pressure, fluid overload, or recent treatment with an intravenous positive inotropic agent. Beta-blockers have been shown to lessen the symptoms of heart failure, improve the clinical status of patients, reduce future clinical deterioration, and decrease the risk of mortality and the combined risk of mortality and hospitalization.  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  Beta-blockers (using 1 of the 3 proven to reduce mortality, i.e., bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained release metoprolol succinate) are recommended for all stable patients with current or prior symptoms of [heart failure] and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), unless contraindicated.  Treatment with a beta blocker should be initiated at very low doses [see excerpt from guideline table below], followed by gradual increments in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated physicians, especially cardiologists and primary care physicians, should make every effort to achieve the target doses of the beta-blockers shown to be effective in major clinical trials.  Beta-blockers Commonly Used for the Treatment of Patients with [Heart Failure] with Low Ejection Fraction                                Drug              Initial Daily Dose(s)              Maximum Dose(s)                                              Beta-blockers                                  Bisoprolol              1.25 mg once              10 mg once                                  Carvedilol              3.125 mg twice              25 mg twice              50 mg twice for patients  85 kg                                  Metoprolol succinate extended release (metoprolol CR/XL)              12.5 to 25 mg once              200 mg once                    For the hospitalized patient:        In patients with reduced ejection fraction experiencing a symptomatic exacerbation of [heart failure] requiring hospitalization during chronic maintenance treatment with oral therapies known to improve outcomes, particularly [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors] or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and beta-blocker therapy, it is recommended that these therapies be continued in most patients in the absence of hemodynamic instability or contraindications.       In patients hospitalized with [heart failure] with reduced ejection fraction not treated with oral therapies known to improve outcomes, particularly [ACE inhibitors] or ARBs and beta-blocker therapy, initiation of these therapies is recommended in stable patients prior to hospital discharge.       Initiation of beta-blocker therapy is recommended after optimization of volume status and successful discontinuation of intravenous diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents. Beta-blocker therapy should be initiated at a low dose and only in stable patients. Particular caution should be used when initiating beta-blockers in patients who have required inotropes during their hospital course.    All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12 month period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percent of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) closest to arrival time receiving fibrinolytic therapy during the hospital stay and having a time from hospital arrival to fibrinolysis of 30 minutes or less. This measure rate should be analyzed in conjunction with the measure rate for the related measure, Acute myocardial infarction (AMI): median time from arrival to administration of fibrinolytic therapy in AMI patients with ST-segment elevation or LBBB on the ECG performed closest to hospital arrival time. These measures, used together, will assist in understanding the number of AMI patients that are receiving fibrinolysis within 30 minutes of hospital arrival and will identify the hospital's median time to fibrinolysis and potential opportunities for improvement to increase the rate of patients receiving fibrinolysis in 30 minutes or less.Time to fibrinolytic therapy is a strong predictor of outcome in patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Nearly 2 lives per 1000 patients are lost per hour of delay (Fibrinolytic Therapy Trialists' Collaborative Group, 1994). National guidelines recommend that fibrinolytic therapy be given within 30 minutes of hospital arrival in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (American College of Emergency Physicianset al., 2013). Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on electrocardiogram (ECG) performed closest to hospital arrival who received fibrinolytic therapy within 6 hours after hospital arrival and the fibrinolytic therapy is primary reperfusion therapy (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients whose time from hospital arrival to fibrinolysis is 30 minutes or less
This measure is used to assess percentage of patients age 18 years and older with venous thromboembolism (VTE) who receive ongoing warfarin therapy with documentation in the medical record indicating a current international normalized ratio (INR) is available and is used to monitor and adjust therapy.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to safely use anticoagulants to reduce the likelihood of patient harm and complications of anticoagulation therapy.  It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year.  A coordinated effort for follow-up of patients started on warfarin is required to minimize the risks of both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications while on treatment. In the first several weeks of anticoagulation, international normalized ratios (INRs) need to be checked at least weekly.  A goal INR target of 2.5 is recommended for the majority of patients who are kept on long-term anticoagulation. Patients who have recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) on adequate anticoagulation with warfarin may require a higher target INR (e.g., 3.0). Number of patients age 18 years and older and diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) who receive ongoing warfarin therapy Number of patients age 18 years and older and diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) who receive ongoing warfarin therapy with documentation in the medical record indicating a current international normalized ratio (INR) is available and is used to monitor and adjust therapy
This measure is used to assess the percent of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older who are prescribed a beta-blocker at hospital discharge.Long-term use of beta-blockers for patients who have suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can reduce mortality and morbidity. Studies have demonstrated that the use of beta-blockers is associated with about a 20% reduction in this risk (Yusuf, Wittes,  Friedman, 1988), and there is evidence of effectiveness in broad populations of patients with AMI (Krumholz et al., 1998). National guidelines strongly recommend long-term beta-blocker therapy for the secondary prevention of subsequent cardiovascular events in patients discharged after AMI (Emergency College of Physicians et al., 2013; Anderson et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2011). Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients who are prescribed a beta-blocker at hospital discharge
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with blood pressure documented in the medical record (every two years if less than 120/80, every year if 120-139/80-89 Hg).The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the rate of patients up-to-date with Level I preventive services.  Level I preventive services are worthy of attention at every opportunity. Busy clinicians cannot deliver this many services in any single encounter. However, with systems in place to track whether or not patients are up-to-date with the high-priority preventive services for their age group, clinicians can recommend the high-priority services as opportunities present.  Hypertension is an important public health problem that affects 25% to 30% of adult Americans. Hypertension is a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, renal failure, stroke and dementia. Conversely, blood pressure control is correlated with a reduction in incidence of myocardial infarctions, strokes and heart failure. Number of patients age 18 years and older (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients age 18 years and older who had blood pressure documented in the medical record (every two years if less than 120/80, every year if 120-139/80-89 Hg)
This measure is used to assess the proportion of stroke patients in each risk-adjusted group, ages 16 years and older, that make at least one level of progress on the Swallowing Functional Communication Measure (FCM).    The Swallowing FCM is one of 15 FCM scales which are used to measure outcomes of speech and language therapy in the realm of swallowing and 14 areas of communication over time.  Each scale is composed of seven-point ratings ranging from least functional (level 1) to most functional (level 7).Changes in Functional Communication Measure (FCM) level provide information on the benefits of treatment designed to enhance functional communication and swallowing.  FCMs were designed to describe aspects of a patient's functional communication and swallowing abilities over time from admission to discharge in various speech-language pathology treatment settings. Stroke patients, ages 16 years and older, with a treatment plan recommending speech and language intervention for a minimum of two sessions. Patients must receive speech and language intervention using either an individual and/or group treatment model or a training and/or consultation model.  See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field. The number of stroke patients in each risk-adjusted group that make at least one level of progress on the Swallowing Functional Communication Measure (FCM)    Note: Refer to the original measure documentation for additional details.
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) who have had influenza immunisation in the preceding 1 August to 31 March.Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of premature death in the United Kingdom (UK). The research evidence relating to the management of CHD is well established and if implemented can reduce the risk of death from CHD and improve the quality of life for patients. This indicator set focuses on the management of patients with established CHD consistent with clinical priorities.   This is a current recommendation from the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator who have had influenza immunisation in the preceding 1 August to 31 March
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with transient ischemic attack (TIA) who are admitted to the hospital, observation unit or expedited outpatient TIA clinic with documentation of clinical TIA symptoms within the last 24 hours.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and over at high risk for stroke presenting with transient ischemic attack (TIA) symptoms within 24 hours who are admitted to the hospital inpatient or observational unit or undergo identical assessment in an expedited outpatient program.  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  Patients whose transient symptoms occurred more than three hours but less than 24 hours ago should be taken to a stroke-ready emergency department expeditiously; use of 911 is at the clinician's discretion. As an alternative to admission to a hospital or observation unit, the patient may be assessed in a specialized clinic or other program in which the evaluation can be carried out as quickly and treatment initiated as definitively as if the patient were admitted to the hospital.  Patients with clinical TIA symptoms within 24 hours and at high risk for stroke should be admitted to a monitored unit (ideally telemetry) for observation and further evaluations. Triaging patients to an inpatient or observation unit status may expedite diagnostic evaluation, allow for ready access to fibrinolysis should the patient have an acute stroke, facilitate early carotid revascularization if indicated, and offer greater opportunity for risk factor modification for secondary stroke prevention (the effect of the "teachable moment" of a hospital stay). Again, expedited outpatient programs may be equivalent. Number of patients admitted to the hospital, observation unit or expedited outpatient transient ischemic attack (TIA) clinic (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients with documentation of clinical transient ischemic attack (TIA) symptoms within the last 24 hours
This measure is used to assess the percentage of hospitalized patients 18 years and older on warfarin for whom current international normalized ratio is used to monitor and adjust therapy.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to improve the safety of using medications by reducing the likelihood of patient harm associated with the use of anticoagulation therapy in inpatient care settings for patients 18 years of age and older. Number of adult patients hospitalized for a medical condition or surgery who are on warfarin and have current international normalized ratio (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of adult patients hospitalized for a medical condition or surgery and on warfarin for whom current international normalized ratio is used to monitor and adjust therapy
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients, regardless of age, with an emergency department diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) who received primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who had documentation that the emergency physician initiated communication with the cardiology intervention service within 10 minutes of the diagnostic 12-lead ECG.This measure addresses the time line that is under the control of the emergency physician. Less time is needed because the contact could be initiated prior to completing the consent process. Some time is needed to evaluate any contraindications and weigh the treatment options.*  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)  If immediately available, primary PCI should be performed in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (including true posterior myocardial infarction [MI]) or MI with new or presumably new left bundle branch block (LBBB) who can undergo PCI of the infarct artery within 12 hours of symptom onset, if performed in a timely fashion (balloon inflation within 90 minutes of presentation) by persons skilled in the procedure (individuals who perform more than 75 PCI procedures a year). (American College of cardiology/American Heart Association [ACC/AHA])  Primary PCI  Preferred treatment if performed by an experienced team less than 90 minutes after first medical contact. (European Society of Cardiology [ESC]) All patients, regardless of age, with an emergency department (ED) diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) who receive primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) Patients with documentation that the emergency physician initiated  communication with the cardiology intervention service within 10 minutes of the diagnostic 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult hospitalized patients 18 years and older with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min in the medical record who receive a reduced dose of anticoagulation therapy.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to reduce the risk of complications from pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for hospitalized and discharged patients 18 years of age and older. Number of adult patients who are hospitalized for a medical condition or surgery with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of adult patients hospitalized for a medical condition or surgery and with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min who receive a reduced dose of anticoagulation therapy
This measure is used to assess the percentage of children in a state ages 2 through 15 years old (ages 24 months and older but less than 16 years) with sickle cell disease (SCD) who received transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography during the measurement year.Approximately 2,000 infants are born with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States each year, a condition that occurs predominantly in people of African and Hispanic descent. Among children with SCD, approximately 11% experience a stroke by 20 years of age. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is used to assess the risk of stroke by detecting abnormally high blood flow velocities in the brain. When these abnormal TCD results are followed by blood transfusion treatment, the risk of first stroke is reduced by 92%. However, despite the usefulness of TCD screening to guide stroke prevention, studies report that only 45% to 68% of children with SCD receive annual TCD screening.  Clinical guidelines and the results of randomized controlled trials indicate that providers should perform TCD annually to identify those children with SCD who are at high risk for stroke. There are no existing quality measures for the use of TCD in children with SCD. The eligible population for the denominator is the number of children in a state ages 2 through 15 years old (greater than or equal to 24 months but less than 16 years) with sickle cell disease (SCD) during the measurement year (January 1 to December 31) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field). The eligible population for the numerator is the number of children in a state ages 2 through 15 years old (ages 24 months and older but less than 16 years) with sickle cell disease (SCD) who received transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography during the measurement year (January 1 to December 31) (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field).
This measure assesses the percent of patients with antihypertensive therapy intensified among patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) with blood pressure greater than 130/80 mmHg and on antihypertensive medications.Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) are situated at a crossroads between patients with less severe chronic kidney disease, where strict blood pressure control is a well established mainstay of therapy, and patients on dialysis, where blood pressure goals are not well understood. In the absence of strong scientific data to define therapeutic targets, blood pressure goals in dialysis patients remain extrapolated from the general population. Because of significantly increased cardiovascular risk in patients with both advanced CKD and diabetes, management of patients with both conditions deserves special attention.  Based on data from patients with advanced CKD as well as extrapolation from those with less severe CKD, lowering blood pressure is an important goal in the advanced CKD population.  Elevated blood pressure is clearly an important risk factor for rapid progression of kidney disease and for cardiac hypertrophy.  Lifestyle modifications improve blood pressure control in the general population and this evidence was deemed by the measure developer to be applicable to patients with advanced CKD.  Studies that specifically examine the use of pharmacological antihypertensive therapy in patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 show that blood pressure can be lowered in this population. In a small number of studies, reduction in blood pressure with antihypertensive medication has been shown to improve measures of renal disease progression and cardiac hypertrophy in patients with advanced CKD.  This recommendation is also based on extrapolation from patients with less severe CKD (GFR greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Reduction in blood pressure with antihypertensive medication clearly improves measures of kidney function, slows the progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and improves clinical outcomes such as clinical cardiovascular events and mortality in these individuals. The number of adult patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), not currently receiving renal replacement therapy, with blood pressure greater than 130/80 mmHg, and on antihypertensive medications The number of patients from the denominator with antihypertensive therapy intensified
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure who were provided with self-care education on three or more elements of education during one or more visits within a 12 month period.Heart failure is a chronic condition that poses a major and growing threat to the public's health. Improving the effectiveness of care and optimizing patient outcomes will become increasingly important as the population of the United States ages.  Patient self-care education is an essential nonpharmacological component to heart failure care. It may reduce the likelihood of nonadherence with recommended therapeuticstrategies and lead to early identification of worsening clinical status and subsequent treatment. Heart failure disease management programs, in which patient education is an integral component, have been shown to be effective in improving self-care and reducing readmissions. This measure is intended to highlight the importance of providing appropriate self-care education to patients with heart failure. The form and manner of education (e.g., counseling, information in the form of pamphlets or booklets) is at the discretion of the individual clinician and should be specific to the needs of the patient. A number of consensus groups and patient advocacy organizations have developed educational materials that are recommended to aid implementation of the measure.   The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  Patients at high risk for developing [heart failure] should be counseled to avoid behaviors that may increase the risk of [heart failure] (e.g., smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and illicit drug use).  It is recommended that patients with [heart failure] and their family members or caregivers receive individualized education and counseling that emphasizes self-care.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with documented aspirin use.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are on appropriate medication management. Due to the high percentage of the United States (U.S.) population that is diagnosed with diabetes and the effect diabetes has on other comorbidities, appropriate management will improve the patient's experience of care and the health of the population, reducing office visits, emergency department visits, and cardiovascular complications. Other related conditions will in turn reduce the total cost of care. Appropriate medication management targeting glycemic control, hypertension, and lipid management is important for reducing morbidity and mortality, and improving long-term quality of life for patients diagnosed with T2DM. Lifestyle changes such as nutrition therapy, weight loss, increased exercise, and appropriate education and self-management strategies are pivotal to improved outcomes. Inadequate access to care for chronic disease management as well as the cost of medication can contribute to poor control of T2DM and associated cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) are at high risk for recurrent events, and aspirin therapy for secondary prevention has been shown to reduce the rate of future events to a clinically meaningful degree. As T2DM is an independent risk factor for ASCVD, patients with T2DM might be expected to benefit from aspirin therapy even before they manifest evidence of ASCVD (Rosiak et al., 2013; Macchia et al., 2012; Soejima et al., 2012; Valentine, Van de Laar,  van Driel, 2012; Antithrombotic Trialists' [ATT] Collaboration et al., 2009; Belch et al., 2008; Ogawa et al., 2008; Campbell et al., 2007; Pignone  DeWalt, 2006).

Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a fairly common procedure. Publication study results indicating unacceptable complication rates from CEA from 1984 to 1989 caused a decrease in the performance of CEA, but clinical trial results from 1989 through 1995 which showed benefit caused a surge in CEA procedures. Approximately 144,000 CEAs were performed in the USA in 1997 (5.3 per 10,000 persons). However, many hospitals perform relatively few procedures, suggesting that the actual annual count of procedures may not be a reliable guide to the number of procedures performed on an ongoing basis. Wenberg et. al. found that 0 percent of institutions in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) trials performed fewer than 17 procedures annually on Medicare beneficiaries. Approximately 50 percent of CEAs performed on Medicare beneficiaries in Ohio in one year were performed by operators who performed less than 21 procedures annually in hospitals that performed less than 62 procedures annually. Although these numbers involve Medicare patients only, Medicare beneficiaries comprise approximately 70 percent of the patients who undergo CEA, so total patient volumes are unlikely to differ substantially.  Our empirical analysis found a mean of 52 procedures per year. While a large number of hospitals perform at least one procedure, a range of hospitals (17 to 37 percent) are considered high volume, depending on the threshold for hospital volume used. The relationship between volume and outcome has been established in the literature, specifically which higher volume hospitals have lower mortality and post-operative stroke rates than lower volume hospitals; differences in patient case-mix do not account fully for these relationships. The relationship may be stronger for hospital volume than for operator volume.   The volume-outcome relationship on which this indicator is based may not hold over time, as providers become more experienced or as technology changes. It is important then to revisit the volume-outcome relationship to ensure the validity of this indicator. Overall, volume measures are not direct measures of quality, and are relatively insensitive. For this reason they should be used with caution and in conjunction with other measure of mortality, to ensure that increasing volumes truly improve patient outcomes.  Our empirical analyses found that many CEA procedures are actually performed at high volume hospitals already. This leaves some room for improvement, but not as much as for other indicators. However, relatively few hospitals are high volume. It is unclear whether simply increasing volume at low volume hospitals would actually improve outcomes. It is possible that hospitals could increase volume simply by increasing the number of borderline or inappropriate procedures performed. For this reason, it may be prudent to examine this indicator alongside area rates for this procedure, and examinations of the appropriateness of the procedures.   Analysis of data from Medicare patients in Ohio in 1994 indicated a significant reduction in the risk of 30 day stroke or death (odds ratio [OR] 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12, 0.69) for procedures performed at high volume hospitals compared with low volume hospitals. Mortality was significantly associated with procedure performance at a trial (NASCET and ACAS) hospital compared with non trial hospitals of any volume (p-trend 0.001). Non-federal hospital data from 1982 through 1994 showed a significant risk of death (p0.0001) in hospitals which performed less than 20 procedures per year. Hospital volume was significantly associated with better outcomes and a doubling of surgeon volume was associated with a 4 percent reduction in adverse outcome risk in a study of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration data from 1992 to 1996. Low volume hospitals were shown to have a significant increase in less severe complications as well as morbidity and mortality when the hospital performed less than 10 procedures annually. Hospital volume data showed a trend (p0.05) for decreased readmission.   Note: The following caveats affect the validity of this indicator:        Proxy: Indicator does not directly measure patient outcomes but an aspect of care that is associated with the outcome; thus, it is best used with other indicators that measure similar aspects of care. This concern has been demonstrated in the literature.       Easily manipulated: Use of the indicator may create perverse incentives to improve performance on the indicator without truly improving quality of care. This concern has been demonstrated in the literature.    This measure applies to providers of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) (one provider at a time). Discharges, age 18 years and older, with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) carotid endarterectomy procedure code (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS) and indications for fibrinolytic treatment and door-needle time less than or equal to 30 minutes.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.   The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.  Early administration of fibrinolytic agents in ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS), when indicated, reduces the size of the infarct, improves residual ventricular function, and reduces morbidity and mortality.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of diabetes and foot ulcer who were prescribed an appropriate method of offloading (pressure relief) within the 12 month reporting period.Offloading is a mainstay in the prevention and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Despite its importance in the care of patients with diabetic foot ulcers, a recent study examining wound care practices found that approximately 23% of patients with diabetic ulcers had no documentation of offloading devices.  The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  The reduction of pressure to the diabetic foot ulcer is essential to treatment. Proper off-loading and pressure reduction prevents further trauma and promotes healing. This is particularly important in the diabetic patient with decreased or absent sensation in the lower extremities. (Frykberg et al., American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons [ACFAS], 2006)  Relieving pressure on the diabetic wound is necessary to maximize healing potential. Acceptable methods of offloading include crutches, walkers, wheelchairs, custom shoes, depth shoes, shoe modifications, custom inserts, custom relief orthotic walkers (CROW), diabetic boots, forefoot and heel relief shoes, and total contact casts. (Wound Healing Society [WHS], 2006)  Removal of pressure from a foot wound (i.e., off-loading) is crucial to the healing process. Many types of devices can offload the infected wound, but it is important to choose one that permits easy inspection. (Lipsky et al., Infectious Diseases Society of America [IDSA], 2004) All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of diabetes and foot ulcer (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who were prescribed an appropriate method of offloading (pressure relief) within the 12 month reporting period (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg or less.Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the developed world. One quarter of stroke deaths occur under the age of 65. There is evidence that appropriate diagnosis and management can improve outcomes.  This indicator measures the intermediate health outcome of a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg or less in patients with hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD). Its intent is to promote the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) through satisfactory blood pressure control. This intermediate outcome can be achieved through lifestyle advice and the use of drug therapy.  In one major overview, a long-term difference of 5 to 6 mmHg in usual diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is associated with approximately 30 to 40 per cent less stroke over five years (Collins et al., 1990). The PROGRESS trial demonstrated that blood pressure lowering reduces stroke risk in patients with prior stroke or TIA (2001).  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline on hypertension (2011) sets blood pressure thresholds for the initiation of drug treatment of hypertension and these are outlined in the rationale for the hypertension indicator set. To summarise, all patients aged 79 or under with CVD and stage one hypertension (clinic blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg or higher and subsequent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring [ABPM] daytime average or home blood pressure monitoring [HBPM] average blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg or higher) are recommended drug therapy for hypertension.  The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) clinical guideline on the management of patients with stroke or TIA (2008) recommends that patients who have had a stroke or TIA and have hypertension are treated to less than 140/85 mmHg.  The NICE clinical guideline on hypertension recommends a target clinic blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg in patients aged 79 or under with treated hypertension and a clinic blood pressure below 150/90 mmHg in patients aged 80 or over, with treated hypertension.  For the purpose of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), an audit standard of 150/90 mmHg has been adopted.  Refer to the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) stroke guideline (2012) for further information. Patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg or less
This measure is used to assess the age-standardized acute care hospitalization rate for conditions where appropriate ambulatory care prevents or reduces the need for admission to the hospital per 100,000 population under age 75 years.Hospitalization for an ambulatory care sensitive condition is considered to be a measure of access to appropriate primary health care. While not all admissions for these conditions are avoidable, it is assumed that appropriate ambulatory care could prevent the onset of this type of illness or condition, control an acute episodic illness or condition, or manage a chronic disease or condition. A disproportionately high rate is presumed to reflect problems in obtaining access to appropriate primary care.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with documentation in the medical record of prognostic assessment preceding or following a course of pharmacologic therapy.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase appropriate clinical risk assessment and stress imaging for stable coronary artery disease patients to determine risk stratification prior to decisions on medical therapy and revascularization.  Prognostic testing is appropriate for patients in whom risk determination remains unclear after initial evaluations have been completed, or in whom cardiac catheterization is deemed inappropriate by the cardiologist. Prognostic testing may precede or follow an initial course of pharmacological therapy.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of cardiac rehabilitation programs in the health care system that meet specified structure-based performance measure criteria.The delivery of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) services is physician directed and provided by a multidisciplinary staff of healthcare professionals. A system for communication between a physician-director with expertise in cardiovascular disease (CVD) management and a referring or primary physician enhances the program's success in helping that patient achieve individualized target goals. It is the responsibility of the physician-director to assure that the information and instruction given to patients in CR is consistent with the most current clinical practice guidelines.  There is a growing trend among patients referred to and completing early outpatient CR to be older, at higher risk, and have more chronic comorbidities. Medical supervision is the most important day-to-day safety factor in CR. Personnel and equipment for advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) are essential to the adequate delivery of emergency care for patients who experience cardiac arrest or other life-threatening events during CR sessions.  Although rare, cardiovascular emergencies can occur during exercise training in CR programs. Studies suggest that the incidence of cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation is approximately 1 arrest every 100,000 patient hours. Practice guidelines for management of cardiac arrest include the use of basic life support (BLS) and ACLS strategies, such as early defibrillation. Such strategies have been shown to help improve outcomes in persons who experience cardiac arrest.  Some CR programs seek certification of their program by healthcare organizations, such as the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR), in order to show that they meet certain standards for the delivery of CR services. Such a certification process, while outside the scope of this document, may result in documentation of a program's ability to meet this and other CR performance measures. Currently, for instance, CR program certification through the AACVPR requires that all policies specified in this measure are in place and operational.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients 18 to 75 years of age with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who had a foot exam (visual inspection with either a sensory exam or a pulse exam) during the measurement year.   This measure is a component of the Comprehensive Adult Diabetes Care composite measureone of 7 different rateslooking at how well an organization cares for the common and serious chronic disease of diabetes.   Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC): For this measure, there are both Electronic and Hybrid Specifications. This NQMC measure summary is based on the Electronic specification. Refer to the original measure documentation for details pertaining to the Hybrid specification.Diabetes is one of the most costly and highly prevalent chronic diseases in the United States. Approximately 20.8 million Americans have diabetes, and half these cases are undiagnosed (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2005). Complications from the disease cost the country nearly $100 billion annually. In addition, diabetes accounts for nearly 20 percent of all deaths in people over 25. Many complications, such as amputation, blindness and kidney failure, can be prevented if detected and addressed in the early stages. Patients 18 to 75 years of age as of December 31 of the measurement year with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) A foot exam (visual inspection with either a sensory exam or a pulse exam) during the measurement year (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the age-standardized rate of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery performed on inpatients in acute care hospitals per 100,000 population age 20 and older.Cardiac revascularization procedures are used to restore or improve blood supply to the heart muscle, which reduces the symptoms of coronary heart disease, such as chest pain and weakness. Revascularization can improve the quality of patients' lives and reduce mortality.  As with other types of surgical procedures, variation in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery rates can be attributed to numerous factors, including differences in population demographics, physician practice patterns, and availability of services. In cases amenable to treatment with less invasive procedures percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), an alternative intervention to improve blood flow to the heart muscle, may be used. Variations in the extent to which PCI is utilized may result in variations in the rate of bypass surgery.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of hypertension seen within a 12 month period with a blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg OR patients with a blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg and prescribed 2 or more anti-hypertensive medications during the most recent office visit.Effective management of blood pressure in patients with hypertension can help prevent cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and the development of heart failure.*  *The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines:  Classification of blood pressure for adults (JNC VII, 2004):                                              Blood Pressure Classification                                          SBP mm Hg                                          DBP mm Hg                                                                          Normal                                          120                                          and 80                                                              Prehypertension                                          120-139                                          or 80-89                                                              Stage 1 Hypertension                                          140-159                                          or 90-99                                                              Stage 2 Hypertension                                          160                                          or 100                                  Treating SBP and DBP to targets that are 140/90 mm Hg is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk complications. In patients with hypertension and diabetes or renal disease, the BP goal is 130/80 mm Hg. (JNC VII, 2004)  Therapy begins with lifestyle modification, and if BP goal is not achieved, thiazide-type diuretics should be used as initial therapy for most patients, either alone or in combination with one of the other classes (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs], angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs], beta blockers [BBs], or calcium channel blockers [CCBs]) that have also been shown to reduce one or more hypertensive complications in randomized-controlled outcome trials. Selection of one of these other agents as initial therapy is recommended when a diuretic cannot be used or a competing indication is present that requires use of a specific drugIf the initial drug selected is not tolerated or contraindicated, then a drug from one of the other classes proven to reduce cardiovascular events should be substituted. (JNC VII, 2004)  Compelling Indications for Use of Individual Drug Classes for Treatment of Hypertension (JNC VII, 2004):  Stable Angina and Silent Ischemia  Unless contraindicated, pharmacologic therapy should be initiated with a BB. BBs will lower BP; reduce symptoms of angina; improve mortality; and reduce cardiac output, heart rate, and atrioventricular (AV) conduction. The reduced inotropy and heart rate decrease myocardial oxygen demand.  If angina and BP are not controlled by BB therapy alone, or if BBs are contraindicated, as in the presence of severe reactive airway disease, severe peripheral arterial disease, high-degree AV block, or the sick sinus syndrome, either long-acting dihydropyridine or nondihydropyridine CCBs may be used. CCBs decrease total peripheral resistance, which leads to reduction in BP and wall tension. CCBs also decrease coronary resistance and enhance post-stenotic coronary perfusion. Nondihyrdopyridine CCBs can decrease heart rate; when in combination with a BB however, they may cause severe bradycardia or high degrees of heart block. Therefore, long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs are preferred for combination therapy with BBs. If angina or BP is still not controlled with this two-drug regimen, nitrates can be added, but these should be used with caution in patients taking phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil. Short-acting dihydropyridine CCBs should not be used because of their potential to increase mortality, especially in the setting of acute MI.  Heart Failure (HF)  HF is a "compelling indication" for the use of ACEI. Abundant evidence exists to justify their use with all stages of HF. In patients intolerant of ACEIs, ARBs may be used. BBs are also recommended for HF because of clinical studies demonstrating decreased morbidity and mortality, and improvement in HF symptoms.  Diabetes  Thiazide-type diuretics are beneficial in diabetics, either alone or as part of a combined regimen. Therapy with an ACEI also is an important component of most regimens to control BP in diabetic patients. ACEIs may be used alone for BP lowering but are much more effective when combined with a thiazide-type diuretic or other antihypertensive drugs. BBs, especially beta 1-selective agents, are beneficial to diabetics as part of multidrug therapy, but their value as monotherapy is less clear. A BB is indicated in a diabetic with IHD but may be less effective in preventing stroke than an ARB as was found in the LIFE study. Although BBs can cause adverse effects on glucose homeostasis in diabetics, including worsening of insulin sensitivity and potential masking of the epinephrine-mediated symptoms of hypoglycemia, these problems are usually easily managed and are not absolute contraindication for BB use. CCBs may be useful to diabetics, particularly as part of combination therapy to control BP.  Chronic Kidney Disease  The joint recommendation of the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation provides useful guidelines for the management of hypertensive patients with CKD. They recommend a goal BP for all CKD patients of 130/80 mm Hg and the need for more than one antihypertensive drug to achieve this goal. The guidelines indicate that most patients with CKD should receive an ACEI or ARB in combination with a diuretic, and many will require a loop diuretic rather than a thiazide. In addition, if there is a conflict between the goals of slowing progression of CKD and cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction, individual decision making is recommended based on risk stratification.

This measure assesses the percentage of patients who developed one or more intra-procedure colonoscopy complications.Colonoscopy is the most sensitive method to detect colorectal neoplasia and prevent deaths from colon cancer, which is the second leading cause of death due to cancer in the United States. Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, no matter what method is used, is cost-effective (Hawk  Levin, 2005). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that from 2003 to 2007, increased screening has decreased CRC incidence and mortality in the United States by almost half (CDC, 2011). Further, although there will continue to be disagreement about what the "best" test is for detecting colorectal cancer, colonoscopy allows the endoscopist to remove lesions and polyps at the time of the procedure (unlike a barium enema or computed tomography [CT] colonography), and may detect cancer in a substantial proportion (45%) of people whose colon cancer is in the proximal colon, which would otherwise go undetected (as opposed to sigmoidoscopy) and lead to death (Rosman  Korsten, 2007; Imperiale et al., 2012; Rozen, Liphshitz,  Barchana, 2012). Additionally, the sensitivity of colonography has been found to be lower than that of colonoscopy overall, and especially poor for polyps less than 5 to 6 millimeters in size (Atkin et al., 2013; Cash et al., 2012; Simons et al., 2012). Colonography does not usually include sedation, use of air to inflate the colon may cause discomfort, and it is not as cost-effectivea follow-up colonoscopy may be required. Colonoscopy is not without cost. Direct costs, risks to patients (such as bowel perforation) and potential patient discomfort (Kim et al., 2012) (although it should be noted that bowel preparation, a significant source of patient discomfort for colonography and colonoscopy, is identical for both procedures), and other related costs must be considered in a cost-benefit analysis. Many national organizations have clinical practice guidelines that recommend colorectal cancer screening for select populations, and several refer to colonoscopy as the preferred screening process in certain patient populations (National Guideline Clearinghouse, 2011). In 2006, of the almost 6.25 million colonoscopy procedures performed in the ambulatory setting, approximately 60% (almost 3.7 million) were performed in freestanding facilities (CDC, 2006).  Perforation of the large intestine is one of colonoscopy's most serious potential complications. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) recommend using incidence of perforation as one measure of colonoscopy quality (Rex et al., 2006).

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older who smoke with documentation in the medical record that advice to quit was provided and/or help to quit was provided.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease who receive education and an intervention for modifiable risk factors.  Modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease need to be evaluated and may include smoking, inadequate physical activity, depression, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Intervention involving any risk factor pertinent to the patient is encouraged and may include education, goal setting, and follow-up as necessary. For all patients, lifestyle modification, including exercise, smoking cessation, achieving and maintaining ideal body weight, and proven risk factor reduction will continue to be the focus of primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention.  Cigarette smoking may cause an acute cardiac ischemic event and may interfere with the efficacy of medications to relieve angina.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of male patients ages 45 to 79 years at risk for myocardial infarctions who receive aspirin chemoprophylaxis counseling.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the rate of patients up-to-date with Level I preventive services.  Level I preventive services are worthy of attention at every opportunity. Busy clinicians cannot deliver this many services in any single encounter. However, with systems in place to track whether or not patients are up-to-date with the high-priority preventive services for their age group, clinicians can recommend the high-priority services as opportunities present.  Based on the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) findings last updated in 2009, aspirin chemoprophylaxis must be encouraged for men ages 45 to 79 years when the potential benefit of a reduction in myocardial infarctions outweighs the potential harm of an increase in serious bleeding events (gastrointestinal hemorrhage and hemorrhagic stroke).  The USPSTF encourages shared decision-making about daily low-dose aspirin use with men and women whose 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke risk, respectively, is closely balanced to their risk of serious bleeding. As the 10-year cardiovascular risk increases compared to the risk of injury from aspirin use, the recommendation to take aspirin should become stronger.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with heart failure diagnosis who have a follow-up appointment with their primary care clinician within seven days of hospital discharge.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the rate of heart failure patients age 18 years and older who have comprehensive patient education and follow-up care.  Heart failure is a major health problem in the United States (U.S.), and the incidence of the disease is increasing. The overall estimated 2004 prevalence of heart failure in adults age 20 and older in the U.S. was 5.2 million, with it being equally distributed among men and women.  Comprehensive discharge planning with detailed written instructions for the patient and caregivers should be implemented to promote compliance and understanding of treatment and educational goals. A discharge follow-up appointment should be scheduled within 7 to 10 days to assess the patient's status, titrate medications toward recommended target doses, and to reinforce and supplement education initiated in the hospital. Communication with the next care clinician needs to be completed in a timely manner so all care team members in all settings have the information necessary to care for the patient. Accountability needs to be assigned for care so the patient doesn't "fall between the cracks" of hospital, primary and specialty care.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a principal discharge diagnosis of heart failure with documentation in the hospital record of the results of a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment that was performed either before arrival or during hospitalization, OR documentation in the hospital record that LVEF assessment is planned for after discharge.Heart failure is a chronic condition that poses a major and growing threat to the public's health. Improving the effectiveness of care and optimizing patient outcomes will become increasingly important as the population of the United States ages.  Evaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with heart failure provides important information that is required to appropriately direct treatment. Several pharmacologic therapies have demonstrated efficacy in slowing disease progression and improving outcomes in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. LVEF assessed during the initial evaluation of patients presenting with heart failure can be considered valid unless the patient has demonstrated a major change in clinical status, experienced or recovered from a clinical event, or received therapy that might have a significant effect on cardiac function.   A comprehensive 2-dimensional echocardiogram with Doppler flow studies has been identified as the single most useful diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients with heart failure.  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  Two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler should be performed during initial evaluation of patients presenting with [heart failure] to assess LVEF, [left ventricular] size, wall thickness, and valve function. Radionuclide ventriculography can be performed to assess LVEF and volumes.  Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography may be useful in evaluating chamber size and ventricular mass, detecting right ventricular dysplasia, or recognizing the presence of pericardial disease, as well as in assessing cardiac function and wall motion. All patients aged 18 years and older with a principal discharge diagnosis of heart failure (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients with documentation in the hospital record of the results of a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment that was performed either before arrival or during hospitalization, OR documentation in the hospital record that LVEF assessment is planned for after discharge (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure assesses the percent of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) with blood pressure less than 130/80 mmHg on index date (i.e., the date blood pressure was measured closest to the time of chart audit).    Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) are situated at a crossroads between patients with less severe chronic kidney disease, where strict blood pressure control is a well established mainstay of therapy, and patients on dialysis, where blood pressure goals are not well understood. In the absence of strong scientific data to define therapeutic targets, blood pressure goals in dialysis patients remain extrapolated from the general population. Because of significantly increased cardiovascular risk in patients with both advanced CKD and diabetes, management of patients with both conditions deserves special attention.  Based on data from patients with advanced CKD as well as extrapolation from those with less severe CKD, lowering blood pressure is an important goal in the advanced CKD population.  Elevated blood pressure is clearly an important risk factor for rapid progression of kidney disease and for cardiac hypertrophy.  Lifestyle modifications improve blood pressure control in the general population and this evidence was deemed by the measure developer to be applicable to patients with advanced CKD.  Studies that specifically examine the use of pharmacological antihypertensive therapy in patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 show that blood pressure can be lowered in this population. In a small number of studies, reduction in blood pressure with antihypertensive medication has been shown to improve measures of renal disease progression and cardiac hypertrophy in patients with advanced CKD.  This recommendation is also based on extrapolation from patients with less severe CKD (GFR greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Reduction in blood pressure with antihypertensive medication clearly improves measures of kidney function, slows the progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and improves clinical outcomes such as clinical cardiovascular events and mortality in these individuals.

This measure is used to assess the percent of surgery patients 18 years of age and older who receive appropriate venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis within 24 hours prior to Anesthesia Start Time to 24 hours after Anesthesia End Time (as defined in the Data Dictionary).There are over 30 million surgeries performed in the United States each year. Despite the evidence that venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the most common postoperative complications and prophylaxis is the most effective strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality, it is often underused. The frequency of VTE, which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is related to the type and duration of surgery, patient risk factors, duration and extent of postoperative immobilization, and use or nonuse of prophylaxis. According to Heit et al. (2000), surgery was associated with over a twenty-fold increase in the odds of being diagnosed with VTE. Studies have shown that appropriately used thromboprophylaxis has a positive risk/benefit ratio and is cost effective. Prophylaxis recommendations for this measure are based on selected surgical procedures from the 2008 American College of Chest Physicians guidelines.  Timing of prophylaxis is based on the type of procedure, prophylaxis selection, and clinical judgment regarding the impact of patient risk factors. The optimal start of pharmacologic prophylaxis in surgical patients varies and must be balanced with the efficacy-versus-bleeding potential. Due to the inherent variability related to the initiation of prophylaxis for surgical procedures, 24 hours prior to surgery to 24 hours post surgery was recommended by consensus of the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) Technical Expert Panel in order to establish a timeframe that would encompass most procedures.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS) and primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) who arrive at the hospital soon with a large infarct and who have door-balloon time less than 90 minutes.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.   The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.   Primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is the treatment of choice for ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS) provided it is done early by an experienced team. The recommended time from first medical contact (FMC) to balloon dilation is less than 2 hours in all cases and less than 90 minutes in patients that reach the hospital soon after an extensive infarct.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients on the chronic kidney disease (CKD) register with hypertension and proteinuria who are currently treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).The international classification developed by the United States (U.S.) National Kidney Foundation describes five stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) using an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to measure kidney function (see Table 3 in the original measure documentation). Patients with CKD stage 3 to stage 5 have, by definition, less than 60 per cent of their kidney function. Stage 3 is a moderate decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with or without other evidence of kidney damage. Several groups (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE], Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [SIGN], United Kingdom [UK] Consensus) have recommended splitting stage 3 into 3A and 3B (see Table 3 in the original measure documentation). Stage 4 is a severe decrease in GFR with or without other evidence of kidney damage and stage 5 is established renal failure. This indicator set refers to patients with stage 3 to stage 5 CKD. CKD is a long-term condition; the most recent population data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999-2004) suggests that the age standardised prevalence of stage 3 to 5 CKD in the non-institutionalised American population is approximately six per cent (Coresh et al., 2007) The prevalence in females was higher than in males (6.9 per cent versus 4.9 per cent). In the fully adjusted model, the prevalence of low GFR was strongly associated with diagnosed diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 1.54; 95 per cent confidence interval [CI], 1.28-180) and hypertension (OR, 1.98; 95 per cent CI, 1.73-2.67) as well as higher body mass index (BMI) (OR, 1.08; 95 per cent CI, 1.02-1.15 per 5-unit increment of BMI). In the UK the prevalence of CKD stage 3 to 5 was 8.5 per cent and was higher in females, 10.6 per cent in females versus 5.8 per cent in males (Stevens et al., 2007). The Association of Public Health Observatories (APHO) (Morgan, 2009) has modelled the prevalence of CKD for England and Wales based on the results of the study by Stevens et al and report a population prevalence of 8.9 per cent. Refer to the National Service Framework (NSF) for Renal Services (2005) for further information. This indicator set applies to patients with stage 3, 4 and 5 CKD (eGFR60 mL/min/1.73 m confirmed with at least two separate readings over a three month period). CKD may be progressive; prevalence increases with age and female sex but progression increases with male sex, and South Asian and African Caribbean ethnicity. People of South Asian origin are particularly at risk of having both diabetes and CKD. Diabetes is more common in this community than in the population overall. People of African and African Caribbean origin have an increased risk of CKD progression linked to hypertension. Only a minority of patients with stage 1 or 2 CKD go on to develop more advanced disease and symptoms do not usually appear until stage 4. Where eGFR has persistently been recorded below 60 the CKD (stage 3) label continues to apply, even if future management may lead to an improvement in eGFR. Early identification of CKD is important as it allows appropriate measures to be taken not only to slow or prevent the progression to more serious CKD but also to combat the major risk of illness or death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). The presence of proteinuria is a key risk multiplier at all stages of CKD and CKD is an independent risk factor for CVD and a multiplier of other risk factors (Wali  Henrich, 2005). Refer to NICE clinical guideline 73, "Early identification and management of chronic kidney disease in adults in primary and secondary care" (2008), and SIGN guideline 103, "Diagnosis and management of CKD in adults" (2008), for further information. These indicators reflect both of the guidance documents.      Albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) is the preferred measure of proteinuria.      NICE suggests blood pressure (BP) is kept below 140 (systolic) and 90 (diastolic) with a target for systolic of between 120 and 139 mmHg. There is a tougher standard for diabetes. This compares with a blood pressure audit standard of 145/85 mmHg in this guidance for 40 to 70 per cent of the CKD population.      NICE recommends that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) when there is hypertension and an ACR of 30 mg/mmol. However, when ACR 70 mg/mmol NICE recommends ACE-I even in the absence of hypertension. As with BP there are stricter standards in diabetes.      NICE divides stage 3 into stage 3a and 3b. NICE recommends testing for bone disease and anaemia in stage 3b (eGFR 30 to 44), as well as stages 4 and 5.      NICE also recommends addition of the suffix (p) to denote significant proteinuria, defined as an ACR 30 mg/mmol (protein:creatinine ratio [PCR] 50 mg/mmol).   ACE-I and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are generally more effective than other anti-hypertensives in minimising deterioration in kidney function and this effect is most marked where there is significant proteinuria. Such treatment is both clinically and cost-effective (Kent et al., 2007; Lewis et al., 1993; Brenner et al., 2001; Ruggenenti et al., 1999). The gold standard test for measuring proteinuria is a 24-hour urine collection; though problems with timing and completeness make this an impractical test to use in general practice. The alternatives are to test the ACR or PCR in the urine or to use a stick test. The SIGN clinical guideline on CKD (2008) recommends measuring proteinuria with ACR in patients with diabetes and total protein:creatinine ratio (TPCR) in non-diabetic patients, reflecting the differing evidence base for these two patient populations whereas recent the NICE clinical guideline on CKD (2008) suggests that the ACR be used in all patients. Therefore, patients who are non-diabetic stage 3 to 5 CKD should have an annual test of proteinuria ideally using ACR, or PCR according to local guidance. Patients with diabetes already have an annual micro-albuminuria test. A systematic review has shown that investigation for infection of asymptomatic patients with one "+" or more is not indicated (Carter et al., 2006). It is advised that practitioners only send a midstream urine sample or perform another test to look for infection if there are symptoms. It is not possible to derive a simple correct factor that allows the conversion of ACR values to PCR or 24-hour urinary protein excretion rates because the relative amounts of albumin and other proteins will vary depending on the clinical circumstances; however, the following table of approximate equivalents will allow clinicians unfamiliar with ACR values to see the approximate equivalent PCR and 24-hour urinary protein excretion rates.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% who were prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy either within a 12 month period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge.  Note: This measure and the Beta-blocker Therapy for Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (see the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse [NQMC] summary Heart failure: percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12 month period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge) address related aspects of care for effective treatment for patients with heart failure and should be measured concurrently. Both ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce mortality and hospitalizations and improve a patient's clinical status. ARBs can be considered a reasonable alternative for ACE inhibitors. Combined treatment with these agents produces additive benefits and is required for optimal management of heart failure. It is not recommended that either of these measures be used independently. The pairing of these measures is not intended to suggest the use of any particular scoring methodology (i.e., a composite score), nor does it imply either equality of or difference in the relative "weights" of the two measures. A performance score for each measure should be reported individually to provide actionable information upon which to focus quality improvement efforts.  The National Quality Forum (NQF) provides definitions of paired and composite measures:        Paired measures are individual measures that should be measured concurrently in the same population; however, the results are not combined into a single score (e.g., measuring mortality and readmission and displaying them togetherbut not calculating a joint score).       A composite measure is a combination of two or more individual measures in a single measure that results in a single score.   Heart failure is a chronic condition that poses a major and growing threat to the public's health. Improving the effectiveness of care and optimizing patient outcomes will become increasingly important as the population of the United States ages.  In the absence of contraindications, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are recommended for all patients with symptoms of heart failure and reduced left ventricular systolic function. ACE inhibitors remain the first choice for inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in chronic heart failure, but ARBs can now be considered a reasonable alternative. Both pharmacologic agents have been shown to decrease the risk of death and hospitalization. Additional benefits of ACE inhibitors include the alleviation of symptoms and the improvement of clinical status and overall sense of well-being of patients with heart failure.  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of [heart failure] and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), unless contraindicated.   Treatment with an [ACE inhibitor] should be initiated at low doses [see excerpt from guideline table below], followed by gradual increments in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated Clinicians should attempt to use doses that have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials. If these target doses of an [ACE inhibitor] cannot be used or are poorly tolerated, intermediate doses should be used with the expectation that there are likely to be only small differences in efficacy between low and high doses.

For the hospitalized patient:        In patients with reduced ejection fraction experiencing a symptomatic exacerbation of [heart failure] requiring hospitalization during chronic maintenance treatment with oral therapies known to improve outcomes, particularly ACE inhibitors or ARBs and beta-blocker therapy, it is recommended that these therapies be continued in most patients in the absence of hemodynamic instability or contraindications.       In patients hospitalized with [heart failure] with reduced ejection fraction not treated with oral therapies known to improve outcomes, particularly ACE inhibitors or ARBs and beta-blocker therapy, initiation of these therapies is recommended in stable patients prior to hospital discharge. Initiation of beta-blocker therapy is recommended after optimization of volume status and successful discontinuation of intravenous diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents. Beta-blocker therapy should be initiated at a low dose and only in stable patients. Particular caution should be used when initiating beta-blockers in patients who have required inotropes during their hospital course.

Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is a technically difficult procedure, with a relatively high mortality rate. Technical errors may lead to clinically significant complications, such as arrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction, colonic ischemia, and death. Mortality is relatively high, especially if the aneurysm has already ruptured. The main evidence for the validity of this indicator arises from the volume-outcome literature. Higher volume hospitals have been noted to have lower mortality rates, suggesting some difference in the processes of care between lower and higher volume hospitals, resulting in better outcomes. What those processes are, if they truly exist, is not known.   AAA is found in 5 to 10 percent of men aged 65 to 79 years. The major complication is aortic rupture which presents as a surgical emergency. The mortality after rupture is high, 80 percent for patients reaching hospital and 50 percent for those undergoing surgery for emergency repair. Currently elective surgical repair is recommended for aneurysms discovered to be larger than 5.5 cm to prevent rupture.   AAA repair is a relatively rare procedure. Our empirical analysis found a mean of 14 procedures per year. While a large number of hospitals perform at least 1 procedure, a range of hospitals (12 to 44 percent) are considered high volume, depending on the threshold for hospital volume used. The relationship between volume and outcome has been established in the literature, specifically that higher volume hospitals have lower mortality than lower volume hospitals; differences in patient case-mix do not account fully for these relationships. Our empirical analysis noted that AAA repair volume was negatively correlated to AAA repair mortality. However, our results do not include the complex risk adjustment contained in the studies reported in the literature.  The volume-outcome relationship on which this indicator is based may not hold over time, as providers become more experienced or as technology changes. It is important then to revisit the volume-outcome relationship to ensure the validity of this indicator. Overall, volume measures are not direct measures of quality, and are relatively insensitive. For this reason they should be used with caution and in conjunction with other measure of mortality, to ensure that increasing volumes truly improve patient outcome.  Hospital discharge practices differ, with some hospitals discharging patients earlier than others. For this reason, this indicator should be considered in conjunction with length of stay and transfer rates (though transfers are excluded in this indicator).  Note: The following caveats affect the validity of the indicator:        Confounding bias: Patient characteristics may substantially affect the performance of the indicator; risk adjustment is recommended. This concern has been demonstrated in the literature.       Unclear construct: There is uncertainty or poor correlation with widely accepted process measures. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and subdural hematoma (SDH)/epidural hematoma (EDH) with intracranial hypertension undergoing surgical intervention within 2 hours.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.  The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.  Delays in surgical treatment of subdural and epidural hematomas in traumatic brain injury (TBI) with signs of intracranial hypertension are associated with worse outcomes and increased mortality.

Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Heart failure (HF) compromised 5.9 percent of the conditions of all Medicare beneficiaries from 1995 through 2004 and accounted for 32.7 percent of the top 5 percent of the most expensive beneficiaries. The increasing age of the US population and increased survival rate of those with chronic heart disease are associated with a doubling of the age-adjusted rate of the prevalence of HF from data from 1973 through 1986.   HF is a progressive chronic disease. Short-term mortality is substantial and varies from provider to provider. Certain treatments have been shown to decrease short-term mortality on a patient level, but it is unknown whether or not such practices decrease provider-level mortality.   While HF mortality has not been studied extensively as an indicator, some have developed risk models for short-term death. Comorbidities and some clinical factors appear important in predicting death. Our empirical analysis confirmed that risk adjustment impacts this indicator. Relative performance is the most impacted, particularly for providers with high and low rates. Therefore, it is important to use some sort of risk adjustment for this indicator; otherwise, some providers may be mislabeled as outliers. Another source of bias is the outpatient management of some patients. Some providers may admit only the most severely ill patients and handle other patients in an outpatient setting, while others do not do this. This results in a more severe case-mix. Providers may wish to examine rates of outpatient care.  Note: The following caveats affect the validity of the indicator:        Selection bias: This results when a substantial percentage of care for a condition is provided in the outpatient setting, so the subset of inpatient cases may be unrepresentative. Examination of outpatient care or emergency care data may help to reduce this in these cases. The concern has been demonstrated in the literature.       Information bias: This indicator is based on information available in hospital discharge data sets, but some missing information may actually be important to evaluating the outcomes of hospital care. Examination of missing information may help to improve indicator performance in these cases. The concern has been demonstrated in the literature.       Confounding bias: Patient characteristics may substantially affect the performance of the indicator; risk adjustment is recommended. The concern has been demonstrated in the literature.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with stable coronary artery disease who are prescribed aspirin and anti-atherosclerotic medications.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease who are prescribed aspirin and anti-atherosclerotic medications.  Antiplatelet Therapy. Aspirin dose in the range of 75 to 150 mg should be given for the long-term prevention of serious vascular events in high-risk patients, and there may be a reduced benefit when increasing the dose over 150 mg daily. Doses available to most clinicians are in increments of 81 mg; therefore, the recommended dose is 81 mg daily.  Patients for whom aspirin is contraindicated (or insufficient) should be treated with clopidogrel 75 mg daily indefinitely.  Statins. Benefit has been demonstrated in all stable coronary artery disease patients treated with statins, regardless of pretreatment cholesterol levels. This was well demonstrated in the MRC/BHF Heart Protection Study. Simvastatin was shown to reduce major cardiovascular events, including death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke by 15% to 20% in the subgroup of patients with pretreatment levels of less than 100 mg/dL. A similar reduction in events was also observed in patients without documented coronary artery disease, but with peripheral vascular disease, diabetes or hypertension.  Every effort should be made to ensure all patients with coronary artery disease receive optimal lipid therapy. Statin medications are strongly supported as first-line medications due to compelling evidence of mortality reduction from multiple clinical trials.  As-needed Nitrates. In patients with mild stable coronary artery disease, drug therapy may be limited to short-acting sublingual nitrates on an as-needed basis. Use of lower dose (e.g., 0.3 mg or one-half of a 0.4 mg tablet) may reduce the incidence of side effects such as headache or hypotension in susceptible patients.  Beta-blocking Agents. Beta-blockers should be used in all status post-myocardial infarction patients, based on studies showing mortality reduction. They are also the preferred first-line therapy for reducing symptoms of angina in patients with stable coronary artery disease.  Ranolazine. Ranolazine is a stand-alone late sodium channel blocker; it relieves stable angina symptoms and increases exercise tolerance. It demonstrates antianginal and anti-ischemic effects without changing hemodynamic parameters (heart rate or blood pressure). Consider the use of ranolazine when beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and nitrates are not adequately effective or are not tolerated.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients in the health care system's cardiac rehabilitation program(s) who meet the specified performance measure criteria for lipid control.  This performance measure is one of ten individual submeasures of the measure subset, Individualized Patient Assessment and Evaluation of Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Development of Individual Interventions, and Communication with Other Healthcare Providers.Multiple clinical trials have shown the benefit of lipid-lowering agents and lifestyle modification for patients with documented cardiovascular disease (CVD). A more aggressive low-density lipoprotein target goal of less than 70 mg/dL should be considered for persons with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, particularly when they are under suboptimal control (e.g., a patient with coronary artery disease who continues to smoke).

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with referral to an appropriate cardiac rehabilitation program (Phase 2 or Phase 3) post-discharge who enroll in the program - Phase Two Programs: electrocardiogram-monitored, outpatient, and Phase Three Programs: non-monitored, outpatient.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using cardiac rehabilitation.  Studies by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute estimate that each year approximately 785,000 Americans will have a new coronary attack and approximately 470,000 will have a recurrent attack.  Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention programs are recommended for patients diagnosed with ST-elevation or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Of particular concern are those patients who carry a moderate or high risk or have multiple modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease and for whom supervised exercise training is deemed appropriate. There is strong evidence to suggest that cardiac rehabilitation programs have been shown to decrease mortality rates in all populations, including younger, more selective populations, as well as the socioeconomically and clinically diverse older population (age 65 and older).  Phase Two Cardiac Rehabilitation   The U.S. Public Health Service described Phase Two cardiac rehabilitation as a "comprehensive, long-term program including medical evaluation, prescribed exercise, cardiac risk factor modification, education and counseling. Phase Two refers to outpatient, medically supervised programs that are typically initiated one to three weeks after hospital discharge and provide appropriate electrocardiographic monitoring." In the past, the main emphasis was exercise based, but today the focus includes risk factor modification, education and counseling.  Research shows that a cardiac rehabilitation program based on regular exercise and education focused on risk factor reduction is both efficient and effective in altering the course of coronary heart disease. The initial outpatient phase includes a comprehensive evaluation, education and treatment for outpatients who have experienced a cardiac-related event. Phase Two patients are monitored with continuous electrocardiogram, blood pressure, heart rate and subjective Rating of Perceived Exertion. For certain patients, referral to a Phase Two program may facilitate earlier hospital discharge by providing emotional support in the outpatient hospital setting.  Phase Three Cardiac Rehabilitation  Phase Three is a maintenance program based on the continuation of a heart healthy lifestyle. The program is designed for patients who have completed a Phase Two cardiac rehabilitation program or for individuals with a cardiac history or significant cardiac risk factors. Patients are not continually monitored by electrocardiogram, but spot-check electrocardiograms and daily blood pressures and heart rates are often recorded. Trained staff, when available, continues to provide support and education for risk factor modification and exercise progression. Warm-up, aerobic exercise, stretching and strength training (when appropriate) are included in Phase Three.

This measure is used to assess whether the contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with atrial fibrillation.Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common and significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The age-specific prevalence of AF is rising, presumably due to improved survival of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) (the commonest underlying cause of AF [Psaty et al., 1997]). One per cent of a typical practice population will be in AF; five per cent of patients aged 65 or over and nine percent of patients aged 75 or over. AF is associated with a five-fold increase in risk of stroke (Wolf, Abbott,  Kannel, 1991).  Refer to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) clinical guidelines "Cardiac arrhythmias in coronary heart disease" (SIGN Publication No. 94, 2007) and "Antithrombotics: indications and management" (SIGN Publication No. 129, 2013) for further information.  Establishing and maintaining disease registers is good professional practice and ensures a defined population is identified for undertaking further evidence-based interventions. Disease registers also make it possible to call and recall patients effectively to provide systematic care and to undertake care audits. This measure applies to contractors whose patient population includes individuals with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (one contractor at a time). The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with atrial fibrillation (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field).
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE) who have a clinical pretest probability (CPTP) assessment completed.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to improve accurate diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE).  It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year.  Key to the evaluation of patients with suspected venous thromboembolism is the use of the provider's clinical evaluation with the help of pretest probability tools as well as judicious use of objective diagnostic tests.  It is well known that clinical findings are poor predictors of the presence or severity of thrombosis; therefore, determining pretest probability is necessary to managing the diagnostic process. This can guide the choice of test(s) needed to triage patients for this condition, which can have minimal signs and symptoms but leads to serious consequences if left untreated.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) with a record in the preceding 12 months that aspirin, an alternative anti-platelet therapy, or an anti-coagulant is being taken.Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of premature death in the United Kingdom (UK). The research evidence relating to the management of CHD is well established and if implemented can reduce the risk of death from CHD and improve the quality of life for patients. This indicator set focuses on the management of patients with established CHD consistent with clinical priorities.   Both the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013, 2011) and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) clinical guidelines ("Management of stable angina," 2007; "Risk estimation," 2007) recommend that aspirin (75 to 150 mg per day) is given routinely and continued for life in all patients with CHD unless there is a contraindication. Clopidogrel (75 mg/day) is an effective alternative in patients with contraindications to aspirin, or who are intolerant of aspirin.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients evaluated in an outpatient setting who in the previous 12 months have experienced an acute myocardial infarction, new or worsening angina that does not meet criteria for unstable angina, or who have undergone coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery, a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), cardiac valve surgery (CVS), or cardiac transplantation, who have not already participated in an early outpatient cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention program for the qualifying event, and who are referred to an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention program.There has been growing scientific evidence over the past 3 decades on the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) services for persons with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence suggests that the benefits of CR services are as significant in recent years as they were in the prethrombolytic era. Because of this mounting evidence, a number of healthcare organizations have endorsed the use of CR services in persons with CVD by including provisions for CR in their practice guidelines and practice management position papers.  Despite both the known benefits of CR and the widespread endorsement of its use, CR is vastly underutilized, with less than 30% of eligible patients participating in a CR program after a CVD event. Reasons for this gap in CR participation are numerous, but the most critical and potentially most correctable reasons revolve around obstacles in the initial referral of patients to CR programs. These obstacles can be reduced through the systematic adoption of standing orders and other similar tools for CR referral for appropriate hospitalized patients. Furthermore, physician accountability associated with the use of these performance measures may lead to new and novel approaches to improve both referral rates and the outcome of patients with CVD.  A key component for CR utilization is the appropriate and timely referral of patients to an outpatient CR program. While referral takes place generally when the patient is hospitalized for a qualifying event (myocardial infarction [MI], chronic stable angina [CSA], coronary artery bypass graft [CABG] surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], cardiac valve surgery, or heart transplantation), there are many instances in which a patient can and should be referred from an outpatient clinical practice setting (e.g., when a patient does not receive such a referral while in the hospital, or when the patient fails to follow through with the referral for whatever reason). This performance measure has been developed to help healthcare systems implement effective steps in their systems of care that would optimize the appropriate referral of a patient to an outpatient CR program.   This measure is designed to serve as a stand-alone measure or, preferably, to be included within other performance measurement sets that involve disease states or other conditions for which CR services have been found to be appropriate and beneficial (e.g., following MI, CABG surgery).  Referral of appropriate outpatients to a CR program is the responsibility of the healthcare provider within a healthcare system that is providing the primary cardiovascular care to the patient in the outpatient setting.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with acute ischemic stroke in the emergency department for whom patient/family education is documented in the medical record.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to improve patient and family education of patients with ischemic stroke in both the emergency department and the admitting hospital unit.  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  A process should be in place for educating the patient and family to the suspected diagnosis, emergency department process, tests to be performed, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment and its risks, and other treatment measures to be considered. This could include face-to-face interaction by the caregiver with the patient and family, as well as teaching tools in written form. Education should be documented in the medical record.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of cardiac rehabilitation programs in the health system that meet this specified performance measure criteria for monitoring response to therapy and documenting program effectiveness.Continuous quality improvement (QI) relies on collecting information about individual response to therapy as well as analysis of aggregate data to assess program effectiveness. The recommendation is that each cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program provides evidence of a standardized method to document individual patient outcomes on completion of the course of CR as defined on intake to the CR program which, in aggregate, will permit documentation of program effectiveness and QI initiative success.  Outcome assessment and evaluation provides evidence of effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. According to a recent report of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, this enhances the migration of best practice to clinical practice, improves decision making and the quality of care provided, and supports the optimal allocation of healthcare resources for all patients.  The 2004 American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR) consensus statement document suggests that "no single form [or] assessment protocol... will fit the needs of all programs." The document gives examples of outcome measures for evaluating program effectiveness and communicating with other healthcare professionals, providing the basis for a flexible "structural framework...that will guide programs in the development of standardized assessment protocols that fit their specific needs."  Initiation and completion of the prescribed course of CR, as defined on admission assessment, are keys to promoting both life-long behavior change as well as physiologic adaptations from regular exercise. Comprehensive CR programs include core components designed to address secondary prevention issues that can improve with patient self-management. Reassessment of outcome measures after completion of CR can help programs assess their performance in each of these core components. It is anticipated that programs would assess different core components outcomes over time, using aggregate results to assess issues such as overall program performance, alternative approaches to programming, and programming in underserved populations such as minorities, women, and the elderly.

This measure is used to assess the time (in minutes) from emergency department (ED) arrival to electrocardiogram (ECG) (performed in the ED prior to transfer) for patients 18 years and older with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or chest pain.Guidelines recommend patients presenting with chest discomfort or symptoms suggestive of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed within a target of 10 minutes of emergency department (ED) arrival (Krumholz et al., 2008). Evidence supports reperfusion benefits patients with identified STEMI (Antman et al., 2008). The diagnosis and management of STEMI patients is dependent upon practices within the ED. Timely ECGs assist in identifying STEMI patients and impact the choice of reperfusion strategy (Peacock et al., 2007). This measure will identify the median time to ECG for chest pain or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients and potential opportunities for improvement to decrease the median time to ECG. Patients 18 years and older with an emergency department (ED) encounter who were discharged/transferred to a short-term general hospital for inpatient care, or to a Federal healthcare facility, with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or angina, acute coronary syndrome, or chest pain, and receiving an electrocardiogram (ECG) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Continuous variable statement: Time (in minutes) from emergency department (ED) arrival to electrocardiogram (ECG) (performed in the ED prior to transfer) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or chest pain patients (with Probable Cardiac Chest Pain) (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with unstable non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) treated with urgent invasive strategy.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.  The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.   Cardiac catheterization should be performed as soon as possible (urgent invasive strategy) in patients with severe unstable non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) at admission and later when this complication occurs. Number of patients with unstable non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients with unstable non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) treated with urgent invasive strategy (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 18 years of age and older during the measurement year who were hospitalized and discharged from July 1 of the year prior to the measurement year to June 30 of the measurement year with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and who received persistent beta-blocker treatment for six months after discharge.According to results of large-scale clinical trials, beta-blockers consistently reduce subsequent coronary events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality by 20 percent to 30 percent after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) when taken indefinitely (Ryan et al., 1999; Phillips et al., 2000). Literature suggests that adherence to beta-blockers declines significantly within the first year (Krumholz et al., 1998; Norwegian Multicenter Study Group, 1994; Yusuf, Wittes,  Friedman, 1988). About half of AMI survivors who are eligible for beta-blocker therapy do not receive it. Test data reveal significant underutilization of beta-blockers 180 days post-myocardial infarction (MI). There is evidence suggesting that around 2,900 to 5,000 lives are lost in the United States in the first year following AMI, from under-prescribing of beta-blockers (Bradford, Chen,  Krumholz, 1999).  In 2004, the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) updated the Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction and indicated that long-term beta-blocker therapy should begin as early as possible after the event for all patients without a contraindication to beta-blockers and continue indefinitely (ACC, 2004). Members age 18 years and older as of December 31 of the measurement year who were discharged from an acute inpatient setting with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) from July 1 of the year prior to the measurement year through June 30 of the measurement year (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) A 180-day course of treatment with beta-blockers (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke within three hours, or up to 4.5 hours for patients meeting selected criteria, of stroke onset who are evaluated by a clinician within 10 minutes of arriving in the emergency department.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and over presenting in time for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) to be initiated within three hours, or up to 4.5 hours for patients meeting selected criteria, of stroke onset who are evaluated within 10 minutes of arriving in the emergency department. Under usual circumstances, these time-related goals should be achievable for patients presenting to an appropriate treatment setting within 2 hours and 30 minutes and 4 hours of symptom onset, respectively.  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  Patients presenting to the emergency department soon after the onset of symptoms may be candidates for treatment with IV tPA and will therefore require a rapid evaluation and treatment initiation. Although the time window from onset of symptoms to treatment can be up to 3 hours, i.e., 180 minutes (or 4 .5 hours, i.e., 270 minutes in selected patients), the evaluation in the emergency department will require at least 30 minutes in most cases (computed tomography [CT] scan of head, laboratory tests performed and results have returned, IV access obtained, neurological exam and history completed, informed consent obtained). Number of patients presenting within three hours, or up to 4.5 hours for patients meeting selected criteria, of stroke onset (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients evaluated by a clinician within 10 minutes of arriving in the emergency department
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) administered beta-blockers during the intensive care unit (ICU) stay.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.  The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality.

Administering beta-blockers is associated with a reduction in the relative risk of progression of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) to acute myocardial infarction, although no significant effect on mortality has been demonstrated. The benefit of indefinite treatment with beta-blockers after NSTE-ACS is well established. The cost of beta-blockers is acceptable. Number of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) administered beta-blockers during the intensive care unit (ICU) stay (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess whether the contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the developed world. One quarter of stroke deaths occur under the age of 65. There is evidence that appropriate diagnosis and management can improve outcomes.  Establishing and maintaining disease registers is good professional practice and ensures a defined population is identified for undertaking further evidence-based interventions. Disease registers also make it possible to call and recall patients effectively to provide systematic care and to undertake care audits. This measure applies to contractors whose patient population includes individuals with a diagnosis of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) (one contractor at a time). The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field).
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period who have a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) result less than 100 mg/dL OR patients who have a LDL-C result greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL and have a documented plan of care to achieve LDL-C less than 100 mg/dL, including at a minimum the prescription of a statin.Managing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to less than 100 mg/dL through use of statins reduces risk of cardiovascular events.  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  Recommended lipid management includes assessment of a fasting lipid profile.        LDL-C should be less than 100 mg/dL.       Reduction of LDL-C to less than 70 mg/dL or high-dose statin therapy is reasonable.       If baseline LDL-C is greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL, LDL-lowering medications are used in high-risk or moderately high-risk persons, it is recommended that intensity of the therapy be sufficient to achieve a 30% to 40% reduction in LDL-C levels.       If on-treatment LDL-C is greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL, LDL-lowering therapy should be intensified.       If baseline LDL-C is 70 to 100 mg/dL, it is reasonable to treat LDL-C to less than 70 mg/dL.     Statins should be considered as first-line drugs when LDL-lowering drugs are indicated to achieve LDL treatment goals. All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who have a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) result less than 100 mg/dL OR patients who have a LDL-C result greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL and have a documented plan of care to achieve LDL-C less than 100 mg/dL, including at a minimum the prescription of a statin (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension aged 30 or over and who have not attained the age of 75, recorded between the preceding 1 April to 31 March (excluding those with pre-existing coronary heart disease [CHD], diabetes, stroke and/or transient ischaemic attack [TIA]) who have a recorded cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment score (using an assessment tool agreed with the National Health Service Commissioning Board [NHS CB]) of greater than or equal to 20% in the preceding 12 months who are currently treated with statins. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death in the United Kingdom (UK) and importantly for patients, the major cause of premature death (before the age of 65). Moreover, of greater significance for the National Health Service (NHS), CVD is not the commonest cause of disability (through stroke and heart failure [HF] particularly) and hospital admission. This results in CVD being the major cost driver for health utilisation and remains the end point disease for many other chronic disorders, especially diabetes and renal disease. Primary prevention works and evidence-based interventions can dramatically reduce risk. This was evidenced in North Karelia when CVD mortality was reduced by 50 per cent through rigid implementation of public health and individual patient interventions. Analysis of coronary heart disease (CHD) trends in Ireland found that over a 15 year period, primary prevention achieved a two-fold larger reduction in CHD deaths than secondary prevention, where 68 per cent of the 2,530 fewer deaths attributable to CHD (using the IMPACT CHD mortality model) having occurred in patients without recognised CHD compared to 32 per cent in CHD patients. For primary prevention of CVD, people at risk need to be identified before CVD has become established. To assess risk in those likely to be at high-risk (for example, people with hypertension) a validated assessment tool is needed that evaluates a range of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline on lipid modification (National Collaborating Centre for Primary Care, 2008) recommends statin therapy for the primary prevention of CVD for adults who have an estimated 20 per cent or greater 10-year risk of developing CVD. A number of risk assessment tools can be used to estimate cardiovascular risk for this Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) indicator. These include:       Framingham      Joint British Society 2 (JBS2)      QRISK   The three assessment tools listed above allow a structured risk assessment to be undertaken. However, each has a different age threshold; so to include the use of all three tools, the age range for this indicator has been set at aged 30 or over and under the age of 75. Contractors will be expected to use one of the three tools to assess their patients. If the tool normally available on the contractor's clinical system is not age appropriate, one of the other tools may be used. Framingham (Anderson et al., 1991) and JBS2 (British Cardiac Society [BCS] et al., 2005) are based on the American Framingham equations. These equations are of limited use in the UK because they were developed in a historic United States population. The equations overestimate risk by up to 50 per cent in most contemporary northern European populations, particularly for people living in more affluent areas and underestimate risk in higher risk populations, such as people who are the most socially deprived. Framingham makes no allowance for a family history of premature CHD and does not take account of ethnicity, but does have a full data set. The newer risk score QRISK has the advantage of including other variables, such as measures of social deprivation, ethnicity and family history. QRISK uses data from UK general practice databases. Framingham and JBS2 The variables needed to estimate risk using the Framingham tool are age, sex, systolic blood pressure (mean of two previous systolic readings), total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking status and presence of left ventricular hypertrophy. JBS2 uses the Framingham variables with the exception of the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Framingham is an assessment of actual, not estimated, risk. The values used should have been recorded no longer than six months before the date of the risk assessment and before any treatment for hypertension. Framingham is not suitable for patients with pre-existing CVD (CHD, angina, stroke, transient ischaemic attack [TIA] or peripheral artery disease [PAD]), diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD) (if the patient has an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] below 60) or familial hypercholesterolemia, or in patients already taking lipid-lowering medication before a new diagnosis of hypertension. The Framingham risk score may be used in patients aged 35 or over and under the age of 75. JBS2 may be used in people aged 40 or over. QRISK The QRISK CVD risk calculator was developed by doctors and academics working in the NHS and is based on routinely collected data from general practitioners (GPs) across the country. The current version of QRISK is QRISK2 (Hippisley-Cox et al., 2008; QRISK 2-2013, 2014). QRISK2 uses the following variables to calculate CVD risk: self-assigned ethnicity, age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, body mass index (BMI), family history of CHD in a first degree relative younger than 60, Townsend deprivation score, treated hypertension, type 2 diabetes, renal disease, atrial fibrillation (AF) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). QRISK2 may be used in patients aged 30 or over and under the age of 85. Clinical Effectiveness of Primary Prevention For people without clinical evidence of CVD, statin therapy is associated with a reduction of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and the composite outcome CHD death or nonfatal MI, fatal and nonfatal stroke and revascularisation. In trials predominantly comprising primary prevention but including a minority of people with established CVD, meta-analysis found that statin therapy was associated with a reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality, fatal and nonfatal MI and the composite outcomes of CHD death, nonfatal MI, fatal or nonfatal stroke and coronary revascularisation. For primary prevention lower intensity statins are safe and cost-effective. It is recommended that treatment for the primary prevention of CVD in patients with hypertension be initiated with simvastatin 40 mg. If there are potential drug interactions, or simvastatin 40 mg is contraindicated, a lower dose or alternative statin preparation may be chosen. The NICE clinical guideline on lipid modification makes recommendations on how a 10-year CVD risk score of 20 per cent or greater should be managed. It also makes recommendations on communication between practitioners and patients about CVD risk assessment and treatment. These include the following:       Setting aside adequate time during the consultation to provide information on risk assessment and to allow any questions to be answered.      Documenting the discussion relating to the consultation on risk assessment and the patient's decision.      Offering information about the person's absolute risk* of CVD and about the absolute benefits and harms of an intervention over a 10-year period. This information:              Presents individualised risk and benefit scenarios          Presents the absolute risk of events numerically          Uses appropriate diagrams and text             The guideline also recommends that if the patient's CVD risk is considered to be at a level that merits intervention but they decline the offer of treatment, they are advised that their CVD risk should be considered again in the future. The guideline also notes that CVD risk may be underestimated in people who are already taking anti-hypertensive or lipid modification therapy, or who have recently stopped smoking. It recommends that clinical judgement be used in such cases to decide on further treatment of risk factors in people who are below the 20 per cent CVD risk threshold. For patients with hypertension, the guideline recommends that before they are offered lipid modification therapy for primary prevention, all other modifiable CVD risk factors are considered and their management optimised if possible. Baseline blood tests and clinical assessment are to be performed and co-morbidities and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia treated. Assessment includes:      Smoking status      Alcohol consumption      BMI or other measures of obesity (see the NICE clinical guideline on obesity [National Collaborating Centre for Primary Care, 2006])      Fasting total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides (if fasting levels are not already available)      Fasting blood glucose      Renal function      Liver function (transaminases)      Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) if dyslipidaemia is present   The NICE guideline on lipid modification also recommends that the decision whether to initiate statin therapy is made after an informed discussion between the responsible clinician and the person about the risks and benefits of statin treatment, taking into account additional factors such as co-morbidities and life expectancy. The guideline also states that a target for total or LDL cholesterol is not recommended for people who are treated with a statin for primary prevention of CVD and that once a person has been started on a statin for primary prevention, repeat lipid measurement is unnecessary. It is recommended that clinical judgement and patient preference should guide the review of drug therapy and whether to review the lipid profile. *See www.npci.org.uk for more information about explaining risk. Patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension aged 30 or over and who have not attained the age of 75, recorded between the preceding 1 April to 31 March (excluding those with pre-existing coronary heart disease [CHD], diabetes, stroke and/or transient ischaemic attack [TIA]), who have a recorded cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment score (using an assessment tool agreed with the National Health Service Commissioning Board [NHS CB]) of greater than or equal to 20% in the preceding 12 months (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator who are currently treated with statins
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients 18 to 85 years of age who had a diagnosis of hypertension and whose blood pressure (BP) was adequately controlled (less than 140/90) during the measurement year.  Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC): Because the diagnosis of hypertension must be confirmed using medical record documentation, the Hybrid Method must be used for this measure.Approximately 50 million Americans have high blood pressure. Numerous clinical trials have shown that aggressive treatment of high blood pressure reduces mortality from heart disease, stroke and renal failure; results are particularly striking in elderly hypertensives, who are more likely to have heart failure. A pool of past clinical trials demonstrated that a 5 to 6 mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure was associated with a 42 percent reduction in stroke mortality and a 14 to 20 percent reduction in mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD).  Literature from clinical trials indicates that 53 to 75 percent of people under treatment achieved control of their blood pressure. The specifications for this measure are consistent with current clinical guidelines, such as those of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the Joint National Committee (Chobanian et al., 2003; American College of Cardiology [ACC], 2004). Patients 18 to 85 years of age as of December 31 of the measurement year with at least one outpatient visit with a diagnosis of hypertension during the first six months of the measurement year (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) The number of patients in the denominator whose most recent blood pressure (BP) is adequately controlled during the measurement year (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of hospitalized patients 18 years and older who are evaluated for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis upon referral or transfer to another setting, service, practitioner or level of care within or outside the organization.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of hospitalized patients 18 years of age and older who are evaluated for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis upon change in level of care, clinicians and/or upon discharge. Number of adult patients who are hospitalized for a medical condition or surgery (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of adult patients hospitalized for a medical condition or surgery evaluated for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis upon referral or transfer to another setting, service, practitioner or level of care within or outside the organization
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients who reported new or worsening dyspnea for whom there was documentation of cause or of investigation of at least one of the following: hypoxia, anemia, bronchospasm or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pleural effusion, tumor obstruction of bronchi or the trachea, pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism.Although great strides have been made in cancer treatment, over one-third of patients with advanced stage cancer will die within 6 months of diagnosis. While much of the oncology literature focuses on the prevention and early, potentially curative treatment of malignancies, palliation of the symptoms of metastatic cancer and its treatment and end of life care are essential for half of the people diagnosed with cancer.  Because symptoms are common and high impact, better symptom management offers a critical opportunity to relieve the burden of living with cancer. Systematic reviews identify pain, fatigue, anorexia, and breathlessness among the most common symptoms. Pooled estimates for the prevalence of symptoms in patients with advanced cancer range from 74% for fatigue to 11% for rash and for diarrhea (pain 71%, anorexia 53%, depression 39%, constipation 37%, insomnia 36%, dyspnea 35%, nausea 31%, cognitive symptoms 28%, oral symptoms 20%, vomiting 20%). Pain remains strikingly common and may affect more than a third of patients with earlier stage disease and more than two-thirds of patients with advanced cancer. The Institute of Medicine targeted improving cancer pain as a national priority.  Good supportive care encompasses four important areas: (1) treatment of cancer-related symptoms (2) prevention and treatment of the side-effects associated with cancer treatment, (3) recognition of and support for patients' experiencing psychosocial distress and (4) end of life care.  The Cancer Quality-ASSIST (Assessing Symptoms Side Effects and Indicators of Supportive Treatment) indicator set was developed to provide tools to assess the extent to which cancer care addresses the symptomatic and informational needs of patients and families. Number of cancer patients who reported new or worsening of dyspnea Number of patients who reported new or worsening dyspnea for whom there was documentation of cause or of investigation of at least one of the following: hypoxia, anemia, bronchospasm or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pleural effusion, tumor obstruction of bronchi or the trachea, pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with any of these diagnosis  venous thromboembolism (VTE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), or pulmonary embolism (PE)  indicating a complete list of medications was communicated to the next clinician of service when the patient is referred or transferred to another setting, service, practitioner or level of care within or outside the organization.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients who are evaluated for medication reconciliation upon change in level of care and/or upon discharge.  It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year. Number of patients age 18 years and older and diagnosed with any of the following diagnoses: venous thromboembolism (VTE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or pulmonary embolism (PE)  Number of patients age 18 years and older and diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or pulmonary embolism (PE) for which a complete list of medications was communicated to the next clinician of service when the patient was referred or transferred to another care setting
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a documented blood pressure in the medical record of 140/90 mmHg or less.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease who receive education and an intervention for modifiable risk factors.  Modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease need to be evaluated and may include smoking, inadequate physical activity, depression, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Intervention involving any risk factor pertinent to the patient is encouraged and may include education, goal setting, and follow-up as necessary. For all patients, lifestyle modification, including exercise, smoking cessation, achieving and maintaining ideal body weight, and proven risk factor reduction will continue to be the focus of primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention.  General health measures include the treatment of hypertension, which is not only a risk factor for development and progression of atherosclerosis, but also causes cardiac hypertrophy, augments myocardial oxygen requirements, and thereby intensifies myocardial ischemia in patients with obstructive coronary disease.  The recommended target blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg or less. Based on current evidence, pursuing blood pressure goals lower than 140/90 should be considered on an individual patient basis based on clinical judgment and patient preference. Number of stable coronary artery disease patients (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of stable coronary artery disease patients who had blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or less
This measure is used to assess the proportion of stroke patients in each risk-adjusted group who have undergone tracheostomy tube placement, ages 16 years and older, that make at least one level of progress on the Voice Following Tracheostomy Functional Communication Measure (FCM).    The Voice Following Tracheostomy FCM is one of 15 FCM scales which are used to measure outcomes of speech and language therapy in the realm of swallowing and 14 areas of communication over time.  Each scale is composed of seven-point ratings ranging from least functional (level 1) to most functional (level 7).Changes in Functional Communication Measure (FCM) level provide information on the benefits of treatment designed to enhance functional communication and swallowing.  FCMs were designed to describe aspects of a patient's functional communication and swallowing abilities over time from admission to discharge in various speech-language pathology treatment settings. Stroke patients who have undergone tracheostomy tube placement, ages 16 years and older, with a treatment plan recommending speech and language intervention for a minimum of two sessions. Patients must receive speech and language intervention using either an individual and/or group treatment model or a training and/or consultation model.  See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 18 to 64 years of age with schizophrenia and cardiovascular disease who had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) test during the measurement year.  Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC): Measure specifications reference value sets that must be used for HEDIS reporting. In this NQMC measure summary, value set references are capitalized and underlined. A value set is the complete set of codes used to identify the service or condition included in the measure. Refer to the original measure documentation for the Value Set Directory.Patients with schizophrenia are likely to have higher levels of blood cholesterol and are more likely to receive less treatment. Patients with schizophrenia and elevated blood cholesterol levels are prescribed statins at approximately a quarter of the rate of the general population. Furthermore, certain atypical antipsychotic drugs increase total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, and decrease high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which increases the risk of coronary heart disease.   Among patients with co-occurring schizophrenia and metabolic disorders, rates of non-treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypertension were 62.4 percent for hypertension and 88.0 percent for dyslipidemia. Atypical antipsychotic medications elevate the risk of metabolic conditions, relative to typical antipsychotic medications. Medicaid members 18 to 64 years of age as of December 31 of the measurement year with schizophrenia and cardiovascular disease (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) A low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) test performed during the measurement year (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percent of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed closest to arrival time receiving primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during the hospital stay with a time from hospital arrival to PCI of 90 minutes or less. This measure rate should be analyzed in conjunction with the measure rate for the related measure, Acute myocardial infarction (AMI): median time from hospital arrival to primary PCI in AMI patients with ST-segment elevation or LBBB on the ECG performed closest to hospital arrival time. These measures, used together, will assist in understanding the number of AMI patients that are receiving primary PCI within 90 minutes of hospital arrival, and will identify the hospital's median time to primary PCI and potential opportunities for improvement to increase the rate of patients receiving primary PCI in 90 minutes or less.The early use of primary angioplasty in patients with ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI) results in a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity. The earlier primary coronary intervention is provided, the more effective it is (Brodie et al., 1998; DeLuca et al., 2004). National guidelines recommend the prompt initiation of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (American College of Emergency Physicianset al., 2013; Kushner et al., 2009). Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed closest to hospital arrival who received primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 24 hours after hospital arrival (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients whose time from hospital arrival to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is 90 minutes or less
This measure is used to assess the percentage of female patients ages 55 to 79 years at risk for ischemic stroke who receive aspirin chemoprophylaxis counseling.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the rate of patients up-to-date with Level I preventive services.  Level I preventive services are worthy of attention at every opportunity. Busy clinicians cannot deliver this many services in any single encounter. However, with systems in place to track whether or not patients are up-to-date with the high-priority preventive services for their age group, clinicians can recommend the high-priority services as opportunities present.  For women ages 55 to 79 years, aspirin chemoprophylaxis must be encouraged when the potential benefit of a reduction in ischemic strokes outweighs the potential harm of an increase in serious bleeding events.  The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force encourages shared decision-making about daily low-dose aspirin use with men and women whose 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke risk, respectively is closely balanced to their risk of serious bleeding. As the 10-year cardiovascular risk increases compared to the risk of injury from aspirin use the recommendation to take aspirin should become stronger.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with a history of myocardial infarction (on or after 1 April 2011) currently treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) (or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB] if ACE-I intolerant), aspirin or an alternative anti-platelet therapy, beta-blocker and statin.Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of premature death in the United Kingdom (UK). The research evidence relating to the management of CHD is well established and if implemented can reduce the risk of death from CHD and improve the quality of life for patients. This indicator set focuses on the management of patients with established CHD consistent with clinical priorities.   There is evidence from meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (level one evidence) for a range of relevant health outcomes, including mortality, to support all patients who have had an acute myocardial infarction (MI) being offered treatment with a combination of the following drugs:        An angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) if ACE-I intolerant       Dual anti-platelet therapy (aspirin plus a second anti-platelet agent)       A beta-blocker       Statin     There is also health economic evidence to suggest that these drug interventions are cost-effective.   The evidence presented below is summarised from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline "MI - secondary prevention in primary and secondary care for patients following a myocardial infarction" (2013).  ACE-I  In the studies reviewed, short-term treatment with an ACE-I in unselected patients immediately after an MI was associated with a small reduction in mortality.   Long-term treatment with an ACE-I in patients with signs of heart failure (HF) and/or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) who have recently experienced an MI was associated with a substantial reduction in all-cause mortality, recurrent MI and re-admission for HF. Where patients are intolerant of an ACE-I (for example because of a cough or allergy) NICE recommends offering an ARB instead.  Aspirin and Anti-platelet Therapy  In the studies reviewed, treatment with aspirin after an MI reduced the risk of death and cardiovascular events. In a subgroup of patients with recent MI, aspirin and clopidogrel (an alternative anti-platelet therapy) have similar cardiovascular benefits.  Warfarin  Patients may be treated with anti-coagulants for the management of co-morbid conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and HF. NICE recommends clinicians take into account bleeding risk, thromboembolic risk and cardiovascular risk when considering treatment in people who have had an MI and who have an indication for anticoagulation. Unless there is a high risk of bleeding, anticoagulation should be continued and aspirin added to treatment. For the purpose of this indicator, anticoagulant therapy will be included in the 'aspirin or an alternative anti-platelet therapy' component of this indicator.  Beta-blocker  In the studies reviewed, in unselected patients after acute MI, long-term treatment with beta-blockers was associated with reduced mortality compared with placebo.  Statins  In a meta-analysis of primary and secondary prevention studies, treatment with a statin was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality.  Refer to NICE guidelines "MI - secondary prevention in primary and secondary care for patients following a myocardial infarction" (2013), "Lipid modification" (2007), and "Lipid modification: cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease" (2008) for further information.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with heart failure diagnosis who were educated on the management of their condition to include:        Physical activity levels       Proper diet       Medications       Daily weight monitoring       What to do if their symptoms worsen   The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the rate of heart failure patients age 18 years and older who have comprehensive patient education and follow-up care.  Heart failure is a major health problem in the United States (U.S.), and the incidence of the disease is increasing. The overall estimated 2004 prevalence of heart failure in adults age 20 and older in the U.S. was 5.2 million, with it being equally distributed among men and women.  Comprehensive education and counseling are essential for patients and caregivers to gain an understanding of the disease process and recommendations for disease management. The goals should focus on giving patients, family and caregivers the knowledge and self-care tools to effectively engage in treatment plans. Emphasis should be placed on understanding the definition and cause of the patient's heart failure, symptom recognition, medication usage and indications, risk factor modification, diet, activity and lifestyle recommendations, and the importance of treatment adherence.  The ability of a patient to understand the disease process and actively participate in heart failure management is linked to better outcomes. It is important for health care clinicians to assess health literacy and provide additional support, educational resources to enhance self-care and optimize heart failure treatment in those with low health literacy. Number of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure who were educated on the management of their condition to include:        Physical activity levels       Proper diet       Medications       Daily weight monitoring       What to do if their symptoms worsen     See the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients in an outpatient clinical practice who have had a qualifying event during the previous 12 months who have been referred to an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program.Evidence clearly shows that patients who participate in cardiac rehabilitation receive a number of health benefits, including the following:        Coordination of post-hospital care through the provision of a medically supervised, comprehensive treatment plan with frequent follow-up and reinforcement during the recuperation phase following a cardiac event.       Improved control of cardiovascular disease risk factors, through aggressive lifestyle changes and the use of appropriate and life-saving preventive medications.       Cardiac rehabilitation improves psychological health by reducing depression and anxiety among participants. This is important because depression and anxiety are common among cardiac patients, and limit both long-term adherence to therapy and follow-up of care.       Significant reduction in rehospitalization rates and unnecessary emergency room visits.       Reduction in all-cause mortality rates by approximately 25%.     The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2004 Guideline Update for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery  Class I  Cardiac rehabilitation should be offered to all eligible patients after CABG.  ACC/AHA 2007 Update of the Guidelines for the Management of Patients with ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)  Class I  Advising medically supervised programs (cardiac rehabilitation) for high-risk patients (e.g., recent acute coronary syndrome or revascularization, heart failure) is recommended.  ACC/AHA 2007 Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Unstable Angina and Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (UA/NSTEMI)  Class I  Cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention programs are recommended for patients with UA/NSTEMI, particularly those with multiple modifiable risk factors and/or those moderate to high-risk patients in whom supervised exercise training is particularly warranted.  Cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention programs, when available, are recommended for patients with UA/NSTEMI, particularly those with multiple modifiable risk factors and those moderate- to high-risk patients in whom supervised or monitored exercise training is warranted.  ACC/AHA 2007 Chronic Angina Focused Update of the Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Chronic Stable Angina  Class I  Medically supervised programs (cardiac rehabilitation) are recommended for at-risk patients (e.g., recent acute coronary syndrome or revascularization, heart failure).  ACC/AHA Guidelines for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Heart Failure in the Adult  Class I  Exercise training is beneficial as an adjunctive approach to improve clinical status in ambulatory patients with current or prior symptoms of heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).  AHA Evidence-Based Guidelines for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Women: 2007 Update  Class I  A comprehensive risk-reduction regimen, such as cardiovascular or stroke rehabilitation or a physician-guided home- or community-based exercise training program, should be recommended to women with a recent acute coronary syndrome or coronary intervention, new-onset or chronic angina, recent cerebrovascular event, peripheral arterial disease, or current/prior symptoms of heart failure and an LVEF less than 40%.  ACC/AHA/SCAI 2007 Focused Update of the Guidelines for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention  Class I  Advising medically supervised programs (cardiac rehabilitation) for high-risk patients (e.g., recent acute coronary syndrome or revascularization, heart failure) is recommended.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) administered acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in the first 24 hours.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.  The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.  Administering acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) reduces mortality and reinfarction in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), making its use mandatory except when contraindicated. Number of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) administered acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in the first 24 hours (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to determine whether or not the hospital has guidelines or protocol for prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE).Several clinical interventions are known to effectively prevent venous thromboembolism. The most appropriate specific intervention will depend on the thrombotic risk, the clinical setting and other factors.    The existence of a protocol approved by the hospital demonstrates the endeavors being made to prevent these adverse events.   This measure applies to hospitals (one hospital at a time). The hospital has a protocol for prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE).
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period and with results of an evaluation of level of activity AND an evaluation of presence or absence of anginal symptoms, with appropriate management of anginal symptoms (evaluation of level of activity and symptoms includes no report of anginal symptoms OR evaluation of level of activity and symptoms includes report of anginal symptoms and a plan of care is documented to achieve control of anginal symptoms).  Note: This measure and the Symptom  Activity Assessment measure (see the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse [NQMC] summary Chronic stable coronary artery disease: percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period for whom there are documented results of an evaluation of level of activity AND an evaluation of presence or absence of anginal symptoms in the medical record) address related aspects of care for effective assessment and management of symptoms for a patient with chronic stable coronary artery disease. The intent of these measures is that they be utilized as a pair, as the results of the Symptom  Activity Assessment provide the basis of decisions that are made in the Symptom Management measure. It is not recommended that either of these measures be used independently. The pairing of these measures is not intended to suggest the use of any particular scoring methodology (i.e., a composite score), nor does it imply either equality of difference in the relative "weights" of the two measures. A performance score for each measure should be reported individually.  The National Quality Forum (NQF) provides definitions of paired and composite measures:        Paired measures are individual measures that should be measured concurrently in the same population; however, the results are not combined into a single score (e.g., measuring mortality and readmission and displaying them togetherbut not calculating a joint score).       A composite measure is a combination of two or more individual measures in a single measure that results in a single score.   In order to effectively manage the symptoms of a patient with chronic stable coronary artery disease, an assessment of those symptoms needs to be performed. This assessment is the basis of any treatment modification that needs to be made. Effective management of the symptoms associated with chronic stable coronary artery disease (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath) through medication management or referral for consideration of revascularization or other additional treatment, may lead to improved patient quality of life which is an important, patient-centered outcome.  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  Beta blockers as initial therapy in the absence of contraindications in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) or without prior MI.  Sublingual nitroglycerin or nitroglycerin spray for the immediate relief of angina.  Calcium antagonists* or long-acting nitrates as initial therapy for reduction of symptoms when beta-blockers are contraindicated.  Calcium antagonists* or long-acting nitrates in combination with beta-blockers when initial treatment with beta-blockers is not successful.  Calcium antagonists* and long-acting nitrates as a substitute for beta-blockers if initial treatment with beta-blockers leads to unacceptable side effects.  *Short-acting, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists should be avoided. All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period and with results of an evaluation of both level of activity AND presence or absence of anginal symptoms (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients with appropriate management of anginal symptoms within a 12 month period (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) (diagnosed on or after 1 April 2014) who have a record of a referral for further investigation between 3 months before or 1 month after the date of the latest recorded stroke or the first TIA.Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the developed world. One quarter of stroke deaths occur under the age of 65. There is evidence that appropriate diagnosis and management can improve outcomes.  Specialist investigations are often only accessible by a referral to secondary care services; therefore, this indicator reflects referral activity rather than confirmation by specific scanning investigations.  Previously this indicator required that practices recorded a referral for further investigation after the last recorded stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). From April 2014 this indicator was amended so that practices are only required to record a referral for further investigations following the first TIA or latest stroke for achievement. This is to allow for clinical discretion for referral of subsequent TIAs. However, practices are reminded that current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Royal College of Physicians guidelines for stroke recommend that patients with suspected TIA should receive specialist assessment and investigation within a time frame based on stroke risk. A TIA is an opportunity to prevent a stroke and therefore good practice is to refer people in line with current national clinical guidelines.  The National Audit Office (NAO) report (2005) notes that only a third of patients with TIA are seen in a TIA clinic. The NAO concern reflects evidence that there is a high early risk of stroke following TIA and that there is insufficient recognition of the serious nature of this diagnosis.  Contractors are advised that a referral should be considered for each new stroke or TIA unless specific agreement has been reached with a local specialist not to refer the patients.  Patients with a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) (diagnosed on or after 1 April 2014) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator who have a record of a referral for further investigation between 3 months before or 1 month after the date of the latest recorded stroke or the first transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease who are prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with stable coronary artery disease with systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) (ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%), including those patients with a comorbidity diagnosis of chronic kidney disease and/or diabetes mellitus.  Among patients with stable angina, ACE inhibitors are most beneficial to patients with left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction, persistent hypertension and diabetes. Patients with normal left ventricular function who also have hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease should be on ACE inhibitors. If the patient cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors, a potential substitute would be ARBs.  A meta-analysis of five placebo randomized controlled trials involving different ACE inhibitors showed reduction in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, as well as myocardial infarction, that were statistically significant. The degree of benefit needs to be assessed individually and may depend on patient characteristics. Number of stable coronary artery disease patients and chronic kidney disease (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of stable coronary artery disease patients who had a prescription for an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period who also have prior myocardial infarction (MI) or a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy.Nonadherence to cardioprotective medications is prevalent among outpatients with coronary artery disease and can be associated with a broad range of adverse outcomes, including all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations, and the need for revascularization procedures.   A patient with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 40% should be taking either bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained release metoprolol succinate. While all beta-blockers appear to be of equal efficacy in patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease, these three medications have specifically shown to reduce mortality in patients with reduced LVEF.  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  It is beneficial to start and continue beta-blocker therapy indefinitely in all patients who have had myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome, or left ventricular dysfunction with or without heart failure symptoms, unless contraindicated.  Beta-blockers (using 1 of the 3 proven to reduce mortality, i.e., bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained release metoprolol succinate) are recommended for all stable patients with current or prior symptoms of heart failure (HF) and reduced LVEF, unless contraindicated. All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period who also have prior myocardial infarction (MI) or a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, not in remission, who were prescribed or received intravenous bisphosphonate therapy within the 12 month reporting period.Multiple myeloma (MM) is a disease characterized by bone destruction, in the form of diffuse osteopenia and/or osteolytic lesions, which develop in 85% of patients. Bisphosphonates can inhibit bone resorption by reducing the number and activity of osteoclasts and therefore could "reduce pain and bone fractures in people with multiple myeloma".*  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  Based on published data and clinical experience, the guidelines recommend the use of bisphosphonates for all patients with multiple myeloma who have bone disease, including osteopenia. In 10% to 20% of patients with earlier-stage disease who do not have bone disease, bisphosphonates may be considered but preferably in a clinical trial. (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN])  Intravenous bisphosphonates should be administered monthly for patients with MM and lytic disease evident on plain radiographs. It is reasonable to start intravenous bisphosphonates in patients with MM who do not have lytic bone disease if there is evidence of osteopenia or osteoporosis on bone mineral density studies. No randomized clinical trials support the use of bisphosphonates in patients with smoldering MM. We believe that bisphosphonates should be used only in the setting of a clinical trial [in these patients]. (Mayo Clinic) All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, not in remission (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who were prescribed or received intravenous bisphosphonate therapy within the 12 month reporting period (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess whether the contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of premature death in the United Kingdom (UK). The research evidence relating to the management of CHD is well established and if implemented can reduce the risk of death from CHD and improve the quality of life for patients. This indicator set focuses on the management of patients with established CHD consistent with clinical priorities.  Establishing and maintaining disease registers is good professional practice and ensures a defined population is identified for undertaking further evidence-based interventions. Disease registers also make it possible to call and recall patients effectively to provide systematic care and to undertake care audits. This measure applies to contractors whose patient population includes individuals with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) (one contractor at a time). The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field).
This measure is used to determine the percentage of patients over 64 years of age who are assessed, with documented evidence, in the first 24 hours after admission to hospital, for the risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE).    Note: This indicator may apply to other ages. Focusing on elderly make possible simultaneous measurement with other indicators in the same sample of patients and underlines the appropriateness of the indicator compliance.Despite widespread education about the need for preventive intervention and the publication of clinical guidelines for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, appropriate prophylaxis continues to be substantially underused, especially in patients at low or moderate risk of venous thrombosis.    Main aim of indicator: to increase the percentage of hospital patients over 64 years of age who are assessed in the first 24 hours after admission for the risk of developing VTE.   Total number of patients over 64 years of age who have been hospitalized at least two days    Note: This indicator may apply to other ages. Number of patients over 64 years of age who are explicitly assessed, with the corresponding entry in their medical record, in the first 24 hours after admission, for the risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) x 100
This measure is used to assess the risk-adjusted rate of all cause in-hospital death occurring within 30 days of first admission to an acute care hospital for individuals age 20 to 105 with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Heart attack, or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), is one of the leading causes of death in Canada. About 18,000 Canadians die as a result of heart attacks every year. Heart attacks are life-threatening emergencies that happen when the coronary arteriesthe blood vessels supplying blood to the heart muscle to keep it workingare suddenly blocked. Lack of blood damages the heart muscle, weakening its function or stopping it altogether, which can be fatal.  A patient's risk of dying in the hospital after a heart attack (AMI) depends on many factors. Some, such as age, cannot be modified after a patient has had an AMI. But breakthroughs in treatments, particularly the timing of re-opening coronary arteries for blood flow, are greatly increasing people's chances of survival. Other care-related practices, such as adhering to expert guidelines and best practices, are also important to achieving better outcomes.  A lower risk-adjusted mortality rate following AMI may be related to quality of care or other factors. It has been shown that the 30-day in-hospital mortality rate is highly correlated (r=0.9) with total mortality (death in and out of hospital) following AMI. Inter-regional variation in 30-day in-hospital mortality rates may be due to jurisdictional and institutional differences in standards of care, as well as other factors that were not included in the adjustment. Total number of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) episodes in an 11-month period (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of deaths from all causes occurring in hospital within 30 days of admission for acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with:        Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD): coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral artery disease (PAD) or stroke presumed of atherosclerotic origin, or       A 10-year risk for CHD greater than or equal to 10%, or       Diabetes, who are on a statin OR have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) less than 100 ml/dL within a 12-month period.   The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients with:        Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD): coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral artery disease (PAD) or stroke presumed of atherosclerotic origin, or       A 10-year risk for CHD greater than or equal to 10%, or       Diabetes, who are on a statin OR have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) less than 100 ml/dL within a 12-month period.     Patients with risk factors for coronary heart disease but no history of disease who receive lipid-lowering therapy are likely to experience a decreased risk of coronary heart disease (Sever et al., 2003; "Major outcomes," 2002; Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group, 2002; Shepherd et al., 2002; Pignone, Phillips,  Mulrow, 2000; Downs et al., 1998; Shepherd et al., 1995; Frick et al., 1987; Lipid Research Clinics Program, 1984).  Patients with a history of coronary disease (including unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction) often benefit from treatment with a statin. Studies have consistently shown a decrease in risk of death from coronary heart disease (Cannon et al., 2004; Nissen et al., 2004; Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group, 2002; Shepherd et al., 2002; LaRosa, He,  Vupputuri, 1999; Goldberg et al., 1998; The Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) Study Group, 1998; Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study Group, 1994).  Thus, for care of patients with established ASCVD, or whose 10-year CHD risk greater than or equal to 10% or who have diabetes, the use of statin therapy is recommended.  Reducing LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels is the primary approach to lowering risk of CHD in both primary and secondary prevention.  Patients with (a) established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), (b) 10-year risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) greater than or equal to 10%, or (c) diabetes Patients who are on a statin therapy OR have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) less than 100 mg/dL (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) 
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with venous thromboembolism (VTE) who develop pulmonary embolism (PE).The priority aim addressed by this measure is to prevent progression or recurrence of thromboembolic disease.  It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE) and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year. Number of patients age 18 years and older and diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE)  Number of patients age 18 years and older and diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) who develop pulmonary embolism (PE)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with heart failure diagnosis and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) who at the last clinic visit met the following (if eligible): prescribed or were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), prescribed or were on beta-blocker therapy, and a non-smoker. The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the rate of heart failure patients age 18 years and older who receive optimum evidence-based pharmacologic treatment.  Heart failure is a major health problem in the United States (U.S.), and the incidence of the disease is increasing. The overall estimated 2004 prevalence of heart failure in adults age 20 and older in the U.S. was 5.2 million, with it being equally distributed among men and women.  The cornerstone of treatment of systolic dysfunction is the use of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Certain beta-blocking medications have been shown to improve clinical symptoms and ventricular function in patients with systolic dysfunction. Beta-blockers decrease hospitalizations and mortality, and have objective beneficial effect on measures of exercise duration.  ACE inhibitors prolong life in patients with heart failure symptoms and ejection fraction (EF) less than 35% and reduce symptom development in asymptomatic patients with EF less than 35%. There is also a mortality benefit in the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with recent myocardial infarction and asymptomatic EF less than 40%.

This measure is used to assess whether the contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients diagnosed with dementia.Dementia is a syndrome characterised by an insidious but ultimately catastrophic progressive global deterioration in intellectual function and is a main cause of late-life disability. The prevalence of dementia increases with age and is estimated to be approximately 20 per cent at the age of 80. The annual incidence of vascular dementia is 1.2/100 overall person years at risk and is the same in all age groups. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 50 to 75 per cent of cases of dementia.  The annual incidence of dementia of the Alzheimer's type rises to 34.3/100 person years at risk in the 90 year age group; the prevalence is higher in women than in men due to the longer lifespan of women. Other types of dementia such as Lewy body dementia and fronto-temporal dementia are relatively rare but can be very distressing. In a third of cases, dementia is associated with other psychiatric symptoms (depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, alcohol related problems). A complaint of subjective memory impairment is an indicator of dementia especially where there is altered functioning in terms of activities of daily living.  There is little evidence to support screening for dementia, and it is expected that the diagnosis will largely be recorded from correspondence when patients are referred to secondary care with suspected dementia or as an additional diagnosis when a patient is seen in secondary care. However, it is also important to include patients where it is inappropriate or not possible to refer to a secondary care provider for a diagnosis and where the general practitioner (GP) has made a diagnosis based on their clinical judgement and knowledge of the patient.  Establishing and maintaining disease registers is good professional practice and ensures a defined population is identified for undertaking further evidence-based interventions. Disease registers also make it possible to call and recall patients effectively to provide systematic care and to undertake care audits. This measure applies to contractors whose patient population includes individuals with a diagnosis of dementia (one contractor at a time). The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients diagnosed with dementia.
This measure is used to assess the percentage of cardiac arrest (CA) alerts and Utstein template correctly completed.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.   The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.  Data collection after cardiac arrest (CA) enables statistical analysis of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. The Utstein style is a uniform system of data recollection that provides precise information about the healthcare process for CA so it can be improved and compared between centers.

This measure is used to assess the number of patients who received venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis or have documentation why no VTE prophylaxis was given the day of or the day after hospital admission or surgery end date for surgeries that start the day of or the day after hospital admission.Hospitalized patients at high-risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) may develop an asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and die from pulmonary embolism (PE) even before the diagnosis is suspected. The majority of fatal events occur as sudden or abrupt death, underscoring the importance of prevention as the most critical action step for reducing death from PE (Geerts et al., 2008). The estimated annual incidence of DVT and PE, known collectively as VTE, is approximately 900,000 (Geerts et al., 2008). Approximately two-thirds of cases of DVT or PE are associated with recent hospitalization. This is consistent with the 2001 report by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). AHRQ indicates that "the appropriate application of effective preventive measures in hospitals has major potential for improving patient safety by reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolism" (Shojania et al., 2001).  Despite its proven effectiveness, rates of appropriate thromboprophylaxis remain low in both medical and surgical patients. A recent analysis from the ENDORSE survey, which evaluated prophylaxis rates in 17,084 major surgery patients, found that more than one third of patients at risk for VTE (38%) did not receive prophylaxis and that rates varied by surgery type (Cohen et al., 2008).  In a review of evidence-based patient safety practices, AHRQ defined thromboprophylaxis against VTE as the "number one patient safety practice" for hospitalized patients (Shojania et al., 2001). Updated "safe practices" published by the National Quality Forum (NQF) recommend routine evaluation of hospitalized patients for risk of VTE and use of appropriate prophylaxis (2006). As noted by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), a vast number of randomized clinical trials provide irrefutable evidence that thromboprophylaxis reduces VTE events, and there are studies that have also shown that fatal PE is prevented by thromboprophylaxis (Geerts et al., 2008).  All patients (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who received venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis or have documentation why no VTE prophylaxis was given:      The day of or the day after hospital admission      The day of or the day after surgery end date for surgeries that start the day of or the day after hospital admission  
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Approximately 795,000 acute strokes occur each year in the U.S., with a mortality rate of 17% and recurrent event rates of 25%. As a single diagnosis, stroke is the fourth leading cause of all death in the U.S. following diseases of the heart, all cancers, and chronic lower respiratory disease, accounting for 1 of every 18 deaths.  Stroke is the second leading cause of all hospital admissions among older patients and the leading reason for neurology-related admissions. From 1999 to 2009, the number of inpatient discharges from short stay hospitals with stroke as the first-listed diagnosis has remained stable with 961,000 discharges in 1999 and 971,000 discharges in 2009 (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI] tabulation, National Hospital Discharge Survey [NHDS], National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS]). Correspondingly, stroke death rates fell by 24% from 1994 to 2004. This decline suggests that there have been general improvements in the management of patients with acute stroke, decreases in the severity of stroke and/or improved detection or coding of milder stroke cases. Part of the decline in hospital stroke mortality may be due to the shorter length of stay resulting in more out of hospital death. The greatest risk of mortality for patients with stroke occurs in the first 30 days, with case-fatality rates ranging from 8% to 20% for ischemic stroke, with substantially higher rates for stroke due to subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage (as high as 50%). The immediate cause of death in more than 60% of stroke cases is thought to be related to complications of the stroke itself. After the first week, cardiac causes, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and other medical complications account for the majority of the stroke-related mortality. In 2008, approximately 46% of all stroke deaths occurred in the hospital (unpublished NHLBI tabulation of NCHS 2008 Mortality Data Set). The annual U.S. economic burden of stroke is estimated at $20.4 billion for direct and $53.6 billion indirect costs.  Note: The following caveats affect the validity of this indicator:        Selection bias: This results when a substantial percentage of care for a condition is provided in the outpatient setting, so the subset of inpatient cases may be unrepresentative. Examination of outpatient care or emergency care data may help to reduce this in these cases. The concern has been demonstrated in the literature.       Information bias: This indicator is based on information available in hospital discharge data sets, but some missing information may actually be important to evaluating the outcomes of hospital care. Examination of missing information may help to improve indicator performance in these cases. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.       Confounding bias: Patient characteristics may substantially affect the performance of the indicator; risk adjustment is recommended. The concern has been demonstrated in the literature.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease and hypertension who are prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with stable coronary artery disease with systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) (ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%), including those patients with a comorbidity diagnosis of chronic kidney disease and/or diabetes mellitus.  Among patients with stable angina, ACE inhibitors are most beneficial to patients with left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction, persistent hypertension and diabetes. Patients with normal left ventricular function who also have hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease should be on ACE inhibitors. If the patient cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors, a potential substitute would be ARBs.  A meta-analysis of five placebo randomized controlled trials involving different ACE inhibitors showed reduction in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, as well as myocardial infarction, that were statistically significant. The degree of benefit needs to be assessed individually and may depend on patient characteristics.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with documentation in the medical record of physical activity goal and when the goal was met.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease who receive education and an intervention for modifiable risk factors.  Modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease need to be evaluated and may include smoking, inadequate physical activity, depression, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Intervention involving any risk factor pertinent to the patient is encouraged and may include education, goal setting, and follow-up as necessary. For all patients, lifestyle modification, including exercise, smoking cessation, achieving and maintaining ideal body weight, and proven risk factor reduction will continue to be the focus of primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention.  Patients should be encouraged to exercise regularly to obtain cardiovascular benefit and to enhance their quality of life. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) endorses a minimum schedule of 30 minutes of aerobic activity, such as brisk walking at least five (preferably seven) times per week, supplemented by an increase in daily lifestyle activities (walking breaks at work, gardening, etc.). Medically supervised programs are recommended for moderate- to high-risk patients. Exercise can be an important adjunct to modification of risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity. In addition, it can enhance patients' perception of their quality of life.  For all individuals, some activity is better than none. Physical activity is safe for almost everyone, and the health benefits of physical activity far outweigh the risks.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg or less.Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of premature death in the United Kingdom (UK). The research evidence relating to the management of CHD is well established and if implemented can reduce the risk of death from CHD and improve the quality of life for patients. This indicator set focuses on the management of patients with established CHD consistent with clinical priorities.  This indicator measures the intermediate health outcome of a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg or less in patients with hypertension and CHD. Its intent is to promote the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) through satisfactory blood pressure control. This intermediate outcome can be achieved through lifestyle advice and the use of drug therapy.   The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline on hypertension (National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2011) sets blood pressure thresholds for the initiation of drug treatment of hypertension and these are outlined in the hypertension indicator set. To summarise, patients with CHD and stage one hypertension are recommended drug therapy for hypertension.   The NICE clinical guideline on hypertension recommends a target blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg in patients aged 79 or under with treated hypertension and a clinic blood pressure below 150/90 mmHg in patients aged 80 or over, with treated hypertension. For the purpose of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), an audit standard of 150/90 mmHg has been adopted for this indicator.   A major overview of randomised trials showed that a reduction of 5 to 6 mmHg in blood pressure sustained over five years reduces coronary events by 20 to 25 per cent in patients with CHD (Collins et al., 1990).  Patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg or less
This measure is used to assess the number of patients who received venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis or have documentation why no VTE prophylaxis was given the day of or the day after initial admission (or transfer) to the intensive care unit (ICU) or surgery end date for surgeries that start the day of or the day after ICU admission (or transfer).Approximately two-thirds of cases of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary emboli (PE) are associated with recent hospitalization. This is consistent with the 2001 report by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (Shojania et al., 2001). AHRQ reports that "the appropriate application of effective preventive measures in hospitals has major potential for improving patient safety, by reducing the incidence of VTE."  Almost all hospitalized patients have at least one risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), and approximately 40% have three or more risk factors. Without thromboprophylaxis, the incidence of objectively confirmed, hospital-acquired DVT is approximately 10% to 40% among medical or general surgical patients and 40% to 60% following major orthopedic surgery (Geerts et al., 2008).   Commonly, criteria for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) itself puts patients at an increased risk for developing VTE, and subsequent increased risk of morbidity from PE. Some risk factors are related to the acute illness present that allowed for the admission to the ICU unit, and some risk factors may be acquired during the ICU admission due to subsequent medical treatments, for example limitations of mobility, presence of central venous lines or mechanical ventilation and subsequent pharmacological paralysis. Reports of DVT in the population of ICU patients vary in relation to the acuity of the illness in this population. DVT in ICU patients diagnosed with routine venography or Doppler ultrasound found ranges between 10% to 100%. Five studies prospectively screened patients who were not receiving thromboprophylaxis during their ICU stays. The rates of DVT using fibrinogen uptake test, Doppler ultrasound or venography ranged from 13% to 31% (Geerts et al., 2008). It is essential for all ICUs to assess each patient upon admission to the ICU unit, a change in level of status, for the need for VTE prophylaxis due to the above increased development of risk factors (Geerts et al., 2004).  Patients directly admitted or transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who received venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis or have documentation why no VTE prophylaxis was given:        The day of or the day after intensive care unit (ICU) admission (or transfer)       The day of or the day after surgery end date for surgeries that start the day of or the day after ICU admission (or transfer)   
This measure is used to assess the percentage of final reports for carotid imaging studies (neck MR angiography [MRA], neck CT angiography [CTA], neck duplex ultrasound, carotid angiogram) performed that include direct or indirect reference to measurements of distal internal carotid diameter as the denominator for stenosis measurement.Since the clinical decision-making is based on randomized trial evidence and degree of stenosis is an important element of the decision for carotid intervention, characterization of the degree of stenosis needs to be standardized. Requiring that stenosis calculation be based on a denominator of distal internal carotid diameter or, in the case of duplex ultrasound, velocity measurements that have been correlated to angiographic stenosis calculation based on distal internal carotid diameter, makes the measure applicable to both imaging and duplex studies.*  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  ...the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) method of calculating stenosis measurement should be employed when angiography is used to correlate ultrasound (US) findings. (Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound [SRU])  For patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic carotid stenosis greater than 70%, as defined using the NASCET criteria, the value of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been clearly established from the results of 3 major prospective randomized trials: the NASCET, the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST), and the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Program. Among symptomatic patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or minor strokes and high-grade carotid stenosis, each trial showed impressive relative and absolute risk reductions for those randomized to surgery. For patients with carotid stenosis less than 50%, these trials showed that there was no significant benefit of surgery. (American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Council on Stroke [AHA/ASA])  It is important to consider that the degree of carotid stenosis in ECST was measured differently than that in NASCET. The degree of carotid stenosis is significantly higher if calculated by the NASCET rather than the ECST method. In summary, it appears that patients with a recent TIA or nondisabling stroke with ipsilateral carotid stenosis benefit from surgery if the stenosis is greater than 50% as measured by the NASCET method; however, this benefit appears to be less pronounced in women. Recently symptomatic patients with greater than 70% stenosis as measured by the NASCET method can expect a far greater benefit from carotid endarterectomy. (American Heart Association [AHA]) All final reports for carotid imaging studies (neck MR angiography [MRA], neck CT angiography [CTA], neck duplex ultrasound, carotid angiogram) performed Final carotid imaging study reports that include direct or indirect reference to measurements of distal internal carotid diameter as the denominator for stenosis measurement (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is one component of a two-part survey measure that assesses different facets of managing aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. This measure uses survey data to assess the percentage of members who are currently taking aspirin, including women 56 to 79 years of age with at least two risk factors for cardiovascular disease; men 46 to 65 years of age with at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease; and men 66 to 79 years of age, regardless of risk factors.   This measure is collected as part of the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Adult Version (commercial, Medicaid).  See the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summary of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) measure Aspirin use and discussion: percentage of women 56 to 79 years of age and men 46 to 79 years of age who discussed the risks and benefits of using aspirin with a doctor or other health provider. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommends that clinicians discuss aspirin chemoprevention with adults who are at increased risk (five-year risk greater than or equal to 3 percent) for coronary heart disease (CHD). Discussions with patients should address both the potential benefits and harms of aspirin therapy. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) encourages the use of aspirin therapy (75-162 mg/day) as a primary prevention strategy in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who are at increased cardiovascular risk, including those who are 40 years of age and older or who have additional risk factors (e.g., family history of cardiovascular disease [CVD], hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, albuminuria).  In 2004, CHD was an underlying or contributing cause of death for 451,300 people and accounted for 1 of every 5 deaths in the United States (U.S.). The prevalence of CHD for both sexes in 2005 was nearly 16 million people, or 7.3 percent of the American population. The cost of cardiovascular diseases and stroke in the U.S. for 2008 was estimated at $448.5 billion, including health expenditures and lost productivity resulting from morbidity and mortality (indirect costs). Evidence shows that age is a strong demographic factor for CHD. It is projected that by 2030, 1 in 5 Americans will be 65 or older. The need for CHD management is essential.  Aspirin treatment has been shown to prevent one cardiovascular event over an average follow-up of 6.4 years. This means that, on average in a 6.4 year time period, the use of aspirin therapy results in a benefit of three cardiovascular events prevented per 1,000 women and four events prevented per 1,000 men. Aspirin has been shown to reduce CHD in patients with peripheral arterial disease, as well.  Aspirin therapy (75-162 mg/day) is also recommended as a secondary prevention strategy in patients who have diabetes and a history of CVD.  Specifications are consistent with current recommendations from USPSTF and ADA. The number of eligible members who responded to the survey and indicated that they did not have a health problem or take medication that makes taking aspirin unsafe, did not have an exclusion and who are:        Women 56 to 79 with at least two risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD)       Men 46 to 65 with at least one risk factor for CVD       Men 66 to 79, regardless of risk factors     See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with atrial fibrillation whose latest record of a CHADS2 score is greater than 1 who are currently treated with anti-coagulation therapy.Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common and significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The age-specific prevalence of AF is rising, presumably due to improved survival of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) (the commonest underlying cause of AF [Psaty et al., 1997]). One per cent of a typical practice population will be in AF; five per cent of patients aged 65 or over and nine percent of patients aged 75 or over. AF is associated with a five-fold increase in risk of stroke (Wolf, Abbott,  Kannel, 1991).  Refer to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) clinical guidelines "Cardiac arrhythmias in coronary heart disease" (SIGN Publication No. 94, 2007) and "Antithrombotics: indications and management" (SIGN Publication No. 129, 2013) for further information.  AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and, if left untreated, is a significant risk factor for stroke and other morbidities.  There is evidence that stroke risk can be substantially reduced by warfarin (approximately 66 per cent risk reduction) and less so by aspirin (approximately 22 per cent risk reduction) ("Risk factors for stroke," 1994).  To help clinicians decide which management path to choose, several tools have been developed to estimate the risk of stroke on the basis of clinical factors (National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions, 2006; Fang et al., 2008; Van Staa et al., 2011; Olesen et al., 2011). The scoring system recommended for Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) is CHADS2, which is validated and particularly suitable for identifying high-risk AF patients, while also being relatively simple to use (Gage et al., 2001). The CHADS2 system is based on the AF Investigators I Study (AFI1) and Stroke Prevention in AF I Study (SPAF1) risk criteria ("Risk factors for stroke," 1994; Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Investigators, 1992).  The revised CHADS2 system scores one point, up to a maximum of six, for each of the following risk factors (except previous stroke or transient ischemic attack [TIA], which scores double, hence the '2'):        C  Congestive heart failure (HF) (one point)       H  Hypertension (one point)       A  Age 75 or older (one point)       D  Diabetes mellitus (one point)       S2  Previous stroke or TIA (two points)     A score of zero is classified as low risk, one is moderate risk and two or more is high risk.  Evidence from the Birmingham AF Treatment of the Aged Study (BAFTA) (Mant et al., 2007) and AF Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events (ACTIVE-W) (Healey et al., 2008) studies suggests that not only is warfarin more effective than aspirin, but that it is not as unsafe (in terms of risk of serious haemorrhage) as previously thought. For example, in the BAFTA trial, the relative risk (RR) for stroke for patients treated with anti-coagulation versus aspirin was 0.46 (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 0.26 to 0.79). The same study showed no significant difference in the rate of haemorrhage between the warfarin and aspirin arms of the study (RR 0.88, 95 per cent CI 0.46 to 1.63), which suggested a shift in the balance between the risks and benefits of warfarin compared with aspirin. However, to date no meta-analysis has been identified combining the results of studies comparing the two treatments for the outcome of haemorrhage.  Anti-coagulation would not necessarily be indicated if the episode of AF was an isolated event that was not expected to re-occur (for example, one-off AF with a self-limiting cause).  This indicator uses the CHADS2 risk stratification scoring system to inform treatment options. The use of a risk stratification scoring system is in line with European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidance that states that 'recommendations for therapy should be based on the presence (or absence) of risk factors for stroke and thromboembolism'.  Where the CHADS2 score is 0 (low risk), then the patient can be offered treatment with aspirin (European Heart Rhythm Association et al., 2010). Where the CHADS2 score is 1 (moderate risk) then either aspirin or anti-coagulants can be offered.  Where the CHADS2 score is greater than 1 the patient is at high risk of having a future stroke and the patient should be offered treatment with anti-coagulation drug therapy. Patients with atrial fibrillation whose latest record of a CHADS2 score is greater than 1 (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator who are currently treated with anti-coagulation therapy (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.As of 2010, an estimated 25.6 million people over age 20 in the U.S. had diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes; this represents more than 11% of this population. Long term complications occur in the majority of diabetic patients to some degree, and include retinopathy (mild to proliferative), neuropathy, nephropathy, and microvascular disorders.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Diabetes Fact Sheet (2011), the risks of stroke and death from heart disease are two to four times higher in people with diabetes. Two-thirds of all adults with diabetes are also hypertensive. Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of blindness and kidney failure in adults. Over two-thirds of diabetics also experience some form of neuropathy.   Long-term diabetes complications are thought to arise from sustained, long-term poor control of diabetes. Intensive treatment programs have been shown to decrease the incidence of long-term complications in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. However, it is unclear whether poor glycemic control arises from poor quality medical care, non-compliance of patients, lack of education, or access to care problems. Areas with high rates may wish to examine these factors when interpreting this indicator. Further information regarding precipitating events to admission may be gathered through chart review.   Diabetes affects a large number of people, as do diabetic complications. Hospitalizations for diabetic complications are not rare, suggesting that reasonably precise estimates may be obtained. However, few studies have documented hospitalization rates for diabetic complications and the extent to which they vary across areas.   Sociodemographic characteristics of the population, such as race, may bias the indicator, since there are higher rates of diabetes and poorer glycemic control among American Indians and Hispanic Americans. Outpatient clinics may also care for long-term complications of diabetes. Thus, examining both inpatient and outpatient data may give a more accurate picture of this indicator.   Long-term diabetes complications are an avoidable hospitalization/ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC) indicator. These indicators are not measures of hospital quality, but rather measures of outpatient care and other healthcare not related to hospitalizations. These measures are of most interest to comprehensive health care delivery systems, such as some health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or public health agencies. ACSC indicators are correlated with each other and may be used in conjunction as an overall examination of outpatient care and access to care at a regional level.   Areas may wish to identify hospitals that contribute the most to the overall area rate for this indicator. The patient populations served by these hospitals may be a starting point for interventions.  Note: The following caveats affect the validity of the indicator:        Proxy: Indicator does not directly measure patient outcomes but an aspect of care that is associated with the outcome; thus, it is best used with other indicators that measure similar aspects of care. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.       Confounding bias: Patient characteristics may substantially affect the performance of the indicator; risk adjustment is recommended. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.       Easily manipulated: Use of the indicator may create perverse incentives to improve performance on the indicator without truly improving quality of care.       Unclear benchmark: The "correct rate" has not been established for the indicator; national, regional, or peer group averages may be the best benchmark available. Indicates that the concern has been demonstrated in the literature.    Discharges in the numerator are assigned to the denominator based on the Metro Area or county of the patient residence, not the Metro Area or county of the hospital where the discharge occurred (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All discharges of age 18 years and older with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) principal diagnosis code for diabetes long-term complications (renal, eye, neurological, circulatory, or complications not otherwise specified) (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter whose assessment of the specified thromboembolism risk factors indicate one or more high-risk factors or more than one moderate risk factor, as determined by CHADS2 risk stratification, who are prescribed warfarin OR another oral anticoagulant drug that is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the prevention of thromboembolism. Anticoagulation should be prescribed for all high risk patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter except those with contraindications to anticoagulation. Aspirin is preferred in patients without risk factors or in those with contraindications to anticoagulation, and is an alternative to anticoagulation in those with only one moderate risk factor.  The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society (ACCF/AHA/HRS) 2011 Focused Update on the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (Update on Dabigatran)  Dabigatran is useful as an alternative to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism in patients with paroxysmal to permanent AF and risk factors for stroke or systemic embolization who do not have a prosthetic heart valve or hemodynamically significant valve disease, severe renal failure (creatinine clearance less than 15 mL/min) or advanced liver disease (impaired baseline clotting function).  2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC) Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation  Chronic Anticoagulation Therapy  (Recommendations other than those listed below pertain to antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF or atrial flutter undergoing cardioversion)        Antithrombotic therapy to prevent thromboembolism is recommended for all patients with AF, except those with lone AF or contraindications.       The selection of the antithrombotic agent should be based upon the absolute risks of stroke and bleeding and the relative risk and benefit for a given patient.       Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist is recommended for patients with more than one moderate risk factor. Such factors include age 75 years or greater, hypertension, heart failure (HF), impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function (ejection fraction 35% or less or fractional shortening less than 25%), and diabetes mellitus.       Antithrombotic therapy is recommended for patients with atrial flutter as for those with AF.    All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter whose assessment of the specified thromboembolic risk factors indicate one or more high-risk factors or more than one moderate risk factor, as determined by CHADS2 risk stratification (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who are prescribed warfarin OR another oral anticoagulant drug that is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the prevention of thromboembolism (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage or patients aged 40 years and older with an emergency department discharge diagnosis of non-traumatic chest pain who had a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed.All patients in the age group for which coronary artery disease/acute coronary syndrome (CAD/ACS) is part of the differential diagnosis, should have an electrocardiogram (ECG) performed.*  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  A 12-lead ECG should be performed and shown to an experienced emergency physician within 10 minutes of ED arrival for all patients with chest discomfort (or anginal equivalent) or other symptoms suggestive of STEMI. (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association [ACC/AHA])  If pain is severe or pressure or substernal or exertional or radiating to jaw, neck, shoulder or arm, then the following are recommended:        ECG (Rule)       Intravenous (IV) access, supplemental oxygen, cardiac monitor, serum cardiac markers (e.g., CKMB), CXR, nitrates, management of ongoing pain, admit (American College of Emergency Physicians [ACEP])    All patients aged 40 years and older with an emergency department (ED) discharge diagnosis of non-traumatic chest pain (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who had a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed
This measure is used to assess the number of patients diagnosed with confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) that are discharged to home, home care, court/law enforcement or home on hospice care on warfarin with written discharge instructions that address all four criteria: compliance issues, dietary advice, follow-up monitoring, and information about the potential for adverse drug reactions/interactions.In anticoagulation therapy programs, patient education is a vital component to achieve successful outcomes, and reducing hospital readmission rate. Patients benefit from education about the potential consequences of both their disease and its treatment (Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement [ICSI], 2006). Warfarin is commonly involved in adverse drug events (Ansell et al., 2008). Adverse drug events can include subtherapeutic clot formation and supertherapeutic hemorrhage. Anticoagulation therapy poses risks to patients due to complex dosing, requisite follow-up monitoring and inconsistent patient compliance. The use of standardized practices for anticoagulation therapy that includes patient/caregiver involvement may reduce the risk of adverse drug events (van Walraven et al., 2006).  The Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goal "Reduce the likelihood of patient harm associated with the use of anticoagulant therapy" states that the organization provides education regarding anticoagulation therapy to patients/family that includes the importance of follow-up monitoring, compliance issues, dietary restrictions, and potential for adverse drug reactions and interactions.  Patients with confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) discharged on warfarin therapy (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients with documentation that they or their caregivers were given written discharge instructions or other educational material about warfarin that addressed all of the following:        Compliance issues       Dietary advice       Follow-up monitoring       Potential for adverse drug reactions and interactions   
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period who also have diabetes or a current of prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% who were prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy. Nonadherence to cardioprotective medications is prevalent among outpatients with coronary artery disease and can be associated with a broad range of adverse outcomes, including all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations, and the need for revascularization procedures.  In the absence of contraindications, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are recommended for all patients with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease and diabetes or reduced left ventricular systolic function. ACE inhibitors remain the first choice, but ARBs can now be considered a reasonable alternative. Both pharmacologic agents have been shown to decrease the risk of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Additional benefits of ACE inhibitors include the reduction of diabetic symptoms and complications for patients with diabetes.  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.   ACE inhibitors should be started and continued indefinitely in all patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to 40% and in those with hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease, unless contraindicated.  Angiotensin receptor blockers are recommended for patients who have hypertension, have indicators for but are intolerant of ACE inhibitors, have heart failure, or have had a myocardial infarction with left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%. All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period who also have diabetes or a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who were prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) therapy (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with cardiovascular disease who received an annual influenza vaccination.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease who receive education and an intervention for modifiable risk factors.  Modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease need to be evaluated and may include smoking, inadequate physical activity, depression, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Intervention involving any risk factor pertinent to the patient is encouraged and may include education, goal setting, and follow-up as necessary. For all patients, lifestyle modification, including exercise, smoking cessation, achieving and maintaining ideal body weight, and proven risk factor reduction will continue to be the focus of primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention.  Patients with cardiovascular disease should have an influenza vaccination as recommended by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Chronic Stable Coronary Artery Disease guideline. Number of stable coronary artery disease patients (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients with cardiovascular disease who received an annual influenza vaccination
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period who were prescribed aspirin or clopidogrel.Use of antiplatelet therapy has shown to reduce the occurrence of vascular events in patients with coronary artery disease, including myocardial infarction and death.  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  Aspirin should be started at 75 to 162 mg per day and continued indefinitely in all patients unless contraindicated.  Clopidogrel when aspirin is absolutely contraindicated. All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery diseaseseen within a 12 month period (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who were prescribed aspirin or clopidogrel (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke who are candidates for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with a "door to drug" time (time of arrival to time of drug administration) of less than 60 minutes.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and over receiving appropriate thrombolytic and appropriate antithrombotic therapy for ischemic stroke (tissue plasminogen activator [tPA] and aspirin, other antiplatelet agents, or an anticoagulant).  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  The term "stroke code" is used to refer to a process in the emergency department for the rapid evaluation and treatment of patients who have presented in a time frame qualifying them for thrombolytic therapy.  The goal of the stroke code is to rapidly administer tPA in appropriately screened candidates. The onset of symptoms to treatment (onset to needle) time can be up to 180 minutes (or 270 minutes in selected patients). Available evidence indicates that reperfusion treatment is more effective in relation to how quickly it is given: time is brain. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommendation for "door to drug" time for intravenous (IV) thrombolytic treatment is within 60 minutes.  However, the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) work group challenges emergency departments and hospitals to streamline their processes further. Time is brain. In the same spirit, it is recommended that patients arriving within 30 minutes of the end of the time window, i.e., 150 minutes or 240 minutes in selected patients, be managed as candidates for IV tPA. A 30-minute or even shorter door to needle time can sometimes be safely achieved. Number of patients eligible for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment and treated with tPA (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients who were treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with a "door to drug" time of less than 60 minutes
This measure is used to assess whether the contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with heart failure.Heart failure (HF) represents the only major cardiovascular disease with increasing prevalence and is responsible for dramatic impairment of quality of life, carries a poor prognosis for patients, and is very costly for the National Health Service (NHS) to treat (second only to stroke). This indicator set refers to all patients with HF unless specified otherwise.  Establishing and maintaining disease registers is good professional practice and ensures a defined population is identified for undertaking further evidence-based interventions. Disease registers also make it possible to call and recall patients effectively to provide systematic care and to undertake care audits. This measure applies to contractors whose patient population includes individuals with a diagnosis of heart failure (one contractor at a time). The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with heart failure.
This measure is used to assess the percentage of type 2 diabetes patients with a blood pressure reading of greater than 140/85 mmHg who have a plan of care.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 and older with uncontrolled hypertension who have a plan of care.  Approximately 30% of the adult population in the United States has hypertension. The majority of people over 65 years of age carry this diagnosis. Therefore, approximately 66.9 million people in the United States carry the diagnosis of hypertension. It is estimated that this number will rise as the number of patients who are over the age of 65, as well as the number of patients who are obese, continue to increase.  Hypertension is the most common reason for adult office visits other than pregnancy and has the highest use of prescription drugs. Despite the number of resources used to treat this disease, only about 50% of hypertensives have their blood pressure under control using the definition of blood pressure less than 140/90.  Poor adherence to lifestyle changes and medication contribute to this poor outcome. Lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, weight loss, increased exercise and limiting alcohol abuse are difficult when there are no symptoms of the disease until secondary problems arise. It is also difficult to continue medications when drug-related side effects arise when the disease itself is asymptomatic. Inadequate access to medical care for chronic disease, as well as the cost of medication, contribute to poor control of blood pressure. Number of type 2 diabetes patients age 18 years and older and with blood pressure greater than 140/85 mmHg (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)  Number of patients age 18 years and older and with type 2 diabetes and blood pressure greater than 140/85 mmHg who have a plan of care
This measure is used to assess the median time (in minutes) from emergency department (ED) arrival to time of transfer to another facility for acute coronary intervention in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years and older.The early use of primary angioplasty in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) results in a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity. The earlier primary coronary intervention is provided, the more effective it is (Brodie et al., 1998; DeLuca et al., 2004). National guidelines recommend the prompt initiation of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients presenting with STEMI (Antman et al., 2008). Patients transferred for primary PCI rarely meet recommended guidelines for door-to-balloon time (Nallamothu et al., 2005). Times to treatment in transfer patients undergoing primary PCI may influence the use of PCI as an intervention (Nallamothu et al., 2005). Current recommendations support a door-to-balloon time of 90 minutes or less (Krumholz et al., 2008). Patients 18 years and older with an emergency department (ED) encounter who were discharged/transferred to a short-term general hospital for inpatient care, or to a Federal healthcare facility, with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed closest to ED arrival, and who were transferred for acute coronary intervention (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Continuous variable statement: Time (in minutes) from emergency department (ED) arrival to transfer to another facility for acute coronary intervention
This measure is used to assess the number of patients diagnosed with confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) who received intravenous (IV) unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy dosages AND had their platelet counts monitored using defined parameters such as a nomogram or protocol.Heparin is commonly involved in adverse drug events (Geerts et al., 2008). Subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic levels can lead to thromboembolic or bleeding complications that may increase the patient's length of stay. The use of weight-based nomograms has increased the likelihood that a therapeutic partial prothromboplastin time (aPTT) will be achieved within the first 24 to 48 hours of therapy. The risk of recurrent thromboembolism is reduced when a therapeutic level of heparin is reached quickly. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) management by weight-based aPTT adjusted protocols have demonstrated their ability through clinical trials to achieve a therapeutic aPTT more rapidly than with standard UFH dosing without increasing major bleeding (Raschke et al., 1993).   Heparin nomograms are superior compared to routine care in the timely achievement of therapeutic anticoagulation despite the trend toward patients having aPTTs above the target range (Gandi, Shojania,  Bates, n.d.). Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) occurs more commonly in patients who receive UFH than in those who receive low molecular weight heparin (Martel et al., 2005). HIT is defined as an unexplained fall in platelet count (specifically, a 50% fall in platelet count from baseline, even if the platelet count remains above 150 x 109/L) (Warkentin et al., 2003). Platelet counts generally begin to fall 5 to 10 days after the initiation of heparin therapy. Prompt recognition of HIT is important so that heparin can be discontinued and the risk of venous and arterial thrombosis minimized.   To detect HIT, platelet count monitoring is recommended for all patients treated with UFH (Warkentin et al., 2003).  Patients with confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) receiving intravenous (IV) unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who have their intravenous (IV) unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy dosages AND platelet counts monitored according to defined parameters such as a nomogram or protocol
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who had a neurological exam of their lower extremities during one or more office visits performed within 12 months.Foot ulceration is the most common single precursor to lower extremity amputations among persons with diabetes. Treatment of infected foot wounds accounts for up to one-quarter of all inpatient hospital admissions for people with diabetes in the United States. Peripheral sensory neuropathy in the absence of perceived trauma is the primary factor leading to diabetic foot ulcerations. Approximately 45-60% of all diabetic ulcerations are purely neuropathic. Other forms of neuropathy may also play a role in foot ulcerations. Motor neuropathy resulting in anterior crural muscle atrophy or intrinsic muscle wasting can lead to foot deformities such as foot drop, equinus, and hammertoes. In people with diabetes, 22.8% have foot problems -- such as amputations and numbness -- compared with 10% of nondiabetics. Over the age of 40 years old, 30% of people with diabetes have loss of sensation in their feet.  CLINCAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS:  Recognizing important risk factors and making a logical, treatment-oriented assessment of the diabetic foot requires a consistent and thorough diagnostic approach using a common language. Without such a method, the practitioner is more likely to overlook vital information and to pay inordinate attention to less critical points in the evaluation. A useful examination will involve identification of key risk factors and assignment into appropriate risk category. Only then can an effective treatment plan be designed and implemented. (American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons/American College of Foot and Ankle Orthopedics and Medicine [ACFAS/ACFAOM] Clinical Practice Guidelines)  Risk categorization should be done according to the following table and follow up treatment plan should be done according to the following table:                                Risk Categorization System                                  Category              Risk Profile              Evaluation Frequency                                              0              Normal              Annual                                  1              Peripheral Neuropathy (LOPS)              Semi-annual                                  2              Neuropathy, deformity, and/or PAD              Quarterly                                  3              Previous ulcer or amputation              Monthly to quarterly                   All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who had a lower extremity neurological exam performed at least once within 12 months (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.The incidence of angina is related to the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD), which is in turn related to the age structure and risk factors (smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes) in a population. Both stable and unstable anginas are symptoms of potential CAD. Stable angina may be managed in an outpatient setting, using drugs such as aspirin, beta blockers, and advice to change diet and exercise habits. Unstable angina may be managed on an outpatient basis, but admission is required for more severe cases, such as patients with recurrent or progressive symptoms.   Unstable angina is a very common reason for hospital admission. One study noted that angina accounted for 16.3 percent of total admissions for avoidable hospitalization/ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSCs). Some angina admissions may be avoidable through proper outpatient care, aimed at treating the effects of coronary artery disease. Little evidence exists regarding the validity of this indicator, and as such there is little guidance as to potential causes of admissions. Areas may wish to examine the outpatient care for angina, as well as emergency room care, to identify potential processes of care that may reduce admission rates.   Angina is an ACSC indicator. These indicators are not measures of hospital quality, but rather measures of outpatient care and other healthcare not related to hospitalizations. These measures are of most interest to comprehensive health care delivery systems, such as some health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or public health agencies. ACSC indicators are correlated with each other and may be used in conjunction as an overall examination of outpatient care and access to care at a regional level.   Areas may wish to identify hospitals that contribute the most to the overall area rate for this indicator. The patient populations served by these hospitals may be a starting point for interventions.  Note: The following caveats affect the validity of the indicator:        Proxy: Indicator does not directly measure patient outcomes but an aspect of care that is associated with the outcome; thus, it is best used with other indicators that measure similar aspects of care. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.       Unclear construct: There is uncertainty or poor correlation with widely accepted process measures. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.       Easily manipulated: Use of the indicator may create perverse incentives to improve performance on the indicator without truly improving quality of care. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.       Unclear benchmark: The "correct rate" has not been established for the indicator; national, regional, or peer group averages may be the best benchmark available. This concern has been demonstrated in the literature.    Discharges in the numerator are assigned to the denominator based on the Metro Area or county of the patient residence, not the Metro Area or county of the hospital where the discharge occurred (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All discharges of age 18 years and older with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) principal diagnosis code for angina (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the proportion of stroke patients in each risk-adjusted group, ages 16 years and older, that make at least one level of progress on the Writing Functional Communication Measure (FCM).    The Writing FCM is one of 15 FCM scales which are used to measure outcomes of speech and language therapy in the realm of swallowing and 14 areas of communication over time.  Each scale is composed of seven-point ratings ranging from least functional (level 1) to most functional (level 7).Changes in Functional Communication Measure (FCM) level provide information on the benefits of treatment designed to enhance functional communication and swallowing.  FCMs were designed to describe aspects of a patient's functional communication and swallowing abilities over time from admission to discharge in various speech-language pathology treatment settings. Stroke patients, ages 16 years and older, with a treatment plan recommending speech and language intervention for a minimum of two sessions. Patients must receive speech and language intervention using either an individual and/or group treatment model or a training and/or consultation model.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke whose time from symptom onset to arrival is less than 3 hours who were considered for tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) administration.  To promote a comprehensive approach to performance improvement, the Stroke and Stroke Rehabilitation Measurement Set is intended for use in its entirety when measuring clinical quality in the care of eligible patients. Full implementation of this measurement set for patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) should always include the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement measure, Radiology: Stenosis Measurement in Carotid Imaging Reports.Patients who arrive at the hospital within 3 hours of stroke symptom onset should be considered for tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) therapy.*  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  We recommend administration of IV t-PA in a dose of 0.9 mg/kg (maximum of 90 mg), with 10% of the total dose given as an initial bolus and the remainder infused over 60 min for eligible patients, provided that treatment is initiated within 3 h of clearly defined symptom onset. We recommend strict adherence to eligibility criteria for the use of IV t-PA based on the NINDS trial protocol. (Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, clinical diagnosis of stroke with a clinically meaningful neurologic deficit, clearly defined time of onset of less than 180 min before treatment, and a baseline CT showing no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. (American College of Chest Physicians [ACCP])  Intravenous rtPA (0.9 mg/kg, maximum dose 90 mg) is strongly recommended for carefully selected patients who can be treated within 3 hours of onset of ischemic stroke. (American Stroke Association [ASA]) All patients aged 18 years and older with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke whose time from symptom onset to arrival is less than 3 hours Patients from the denominator who were considered for tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) administration (given t-PA or documented reasons for patient not being a candidate for therapy) (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of emergency department (ED) acute ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke patients who arrive at the ED within 2 hours of the onset of symptoms who have a head computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan performed during the stay and having a time from ED arrival to interpretation of the head CT or MRI scan within 45 minutes of arrival.Improved access to diagnostic imaging assists clinicians in the decision making process and treatment plans. Over 143,579 people die each year from stroke (The Internet Stroke Center, 2009). Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Each year, about 795,000 people suffer a stroke. About 600,000 of these are first attacks, and 185,000 are recurrent attacks (Lloyd-Jones et al., 2009). Decreasing radiology turnaround times will enhance decision making capabilities for patients with TIA or Acute Ischemic Stroke. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) for treatment of acute ischemic stroke when given within three hours of stroke symptom onset (Brott et al., 2000). Of all strokes, 87 percent are ischemic, 10 percent are intracerebral hemorrhage, and 3 percent are subarachnoid hemorrhage (Hacke et al., 2004). Because of the therapeutic time window for treatment possibilities, timely completion and results of the CT or MRI scan are imperative and will directly impact the quality of care a patient receives.  Improved access to diagnostics assists clinicians in decision making. Diagnostic imaging and laboratory reports are expected to increase length of stay in the emergency department. Radiology report turnaround time can impact patient throughput times in the emergency department (DeFlorio et al., 2008). Decreasing radiology report turnaround times can have impacts across the facility and assist in reducing the length of stay and enhancing decision making capabilities for patient treatment plans (Marquez, 2005). Efficiencies in throughput with tasks can lead to less diversion, less overcrowding, less elopements, and less financial loss (Falvo et al., 2007). Patients 18 years and older with an emergency department (ED) encounter and a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke who had an order for a head computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Emergency department (ED) acute ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke patients arriving at the ED within 2 hours of the time last known well, with an order for a head computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan whose time from ED arrival to interpretation of the head CT scan is within 45 minutes of arrival
This measure is used to assess the age-standardized rate of new stroke events admitted to an acute care hospital per 100,000 population age 20 and older. A new event is defined as a first-ever hospitalization for stroke or a recurrent hospitalized stroke occurring more than 28 days after the admission for the previous event in the reference period.Stroke is one of the leading causes of long-term disability and death. Measuring its occurrence in the population is important for planning and evaluating of preventive strategies, allocating health resources and estimating costs. From a disease surveillance perspective, there are three groups of strokes: fatal events occurring out of the hospital, non-fatal stokes managed outside acute care hospitals and those admitted to an acute care facility. Although strokes admitted to a hospital do not reflect all stroke events in the community, this information provides a useful and timely estimate of the disease occurrence in the population.  Monitoring strokes over time can help to understand whether the efforts to prevent stroke are succeeding. Understanding variations among jurisdictions and over time may point to differences in lifestyle, awareness about the signs and symptoms of stroke or the provision of preventive care, as well as other factors. This indicator can provide a useful and timely estimate for planning and evaluating preventive strategies, allocating health resources and estimating costs. Total mid-year population age 20 and older Total number of new stroke events for persons age 20 and older (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
The measure is used to assess the proportion of stroke patients in each risk-adjusted group, ages 16 years and older, that make at least one level of progress on the Reading Functional Communication Measure (FCM).    The Reading FCM is one of 15 FCM scales which are used to measure outcomes of speech and language therapy in the realm of swallowing and 14 areas of communication over time.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 18 to 85 years of age who had a diagnosis of hypertension and whose blood pressure (BP) was adequately controlled during the measurement year based on the following criteria:       Members 18 to 59 years of age whose BP was less than 140/90 mm Hg      Members 60 to 85 years of age with a diagnosis of diabetes whose BP was less than 140/90 mm Hg      Members 60 to 85 years of age without a diagnosis of diabetes whose BP was less than 150/90 mm Hg   Note: A single rate is reported and is the sum of all three groups.Approximately 67 million Americans have high blood pressure (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). Treatment to improve hypertension includes dietary and lifestyle changes, as well as appropriate use of medications.   The specifications for this measure are consistent with current clinical guidelines, such as those of the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the Joint National Committee (James et al., 2014).  Members 18 to 85 years of age as of December 31 of the measurement year with at least one outpatient visit with a diagnosis of hypertension during the first six months of the measurement year (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) The number of members in the denominator whose most recent blood pressure (BP) (both systolic and diastolic) is adequately controlled during the measurement year (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of eligible patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke who are treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and over receiving appropriate thrombolytic and appropriate antithrombotic therapy for ischemic stroke (tissue plasminogen activator [tPA] and aspirin, other antiplatelet agents, or an anticoagulant).  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  Patients presenting to the emergency department soon after the onset of symptoms may be candidates for treatment with intravenous (IV) tPA and will therefore require a rapid evaluation and treatment initiation.  A qualified clinician (i.e., trained and experienced in acute stroke management or supported via telemedicine arrangement by such a clinician) should administer IV tPA to selected and qualifying patients with acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset or of time last known to be at their baselines in appropriate care circumstances (i.e., in a "stroke-ready" emergency department or hospital).  Stakes are high, impact of treatment is substantial, and evidence is strong for treatment of appropriately selected patients.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of heart failure patients age 18 years and older who are current smokers or tobacco users who received smoking cessation advice or counseling in primary care.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the rate of heart failure patients age 18 years and older who have comprehensive patient education and follow-up care.  Heart failure is a major health problem in the United States (U.S.), and the incidence of the disease is increasing. The overall estimated 2004 prevalence of heart failure in adults age 20 and older in the U.S. was 5.2 million, with it being equally distributed among men and women.  Cigarette smoking increases the incidence of congestive heart failure. As heart failure continues to increase in prevalence in the U.S., there is a need to look at how to prevent decompensation of previously stable heart failure patients. Several precipitating factors have been suggested in the relapse of heart failure, and one of them includes cigarette smoking.   Research on the participants in the Study of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) showed that current cigarette smoking increased mortality and hospitalization compared to ex-smokers and those who never smoked. Quitting smoking is associated with a significant decrease in risk of all-cause mortality among patients with coronary heart disease. In fact, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, research on the SOLVD participants showed that quitting smoking substantially decreases morbidity and mortality within two years. Number of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure and current smokers or tobacco users (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure and current smokers or tobacco users who received counseling or advice on smoking cessation at the last clinic visit
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with ischemic stroke undergoing intravenous fibrinolysis. The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.  The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.  Intravenous fibrinolysis performed within 3 hours of onset of symptoms reduces sequelae in these patients, leading to better quality of life. Some studies suggest the therapeutic window can be extended to 4.5 hours.  Recommended door-needle time is less than 60 minutes from arrival at the emergency department.

This measure is used to assess the percent of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older who received aspirin within 24 hours before or after hospital arrival.The early use of aspirin in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) results in a significant reduction in adverse events and subsequent mortality. The benefits of aspirin therapy on mortality are comparable to fibrinolytic therapy. The combination of aspirin and fibrinolytics provides additive benefits for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction ("Randomised trial," 1988). Aspirin is also effective in patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (Theroux et al., 1988; "Risk of myocardial infarction," 1990). National guidelines strongly recommend early aspirin for patients hospitalized with AMI (American College of Emergency Physicians et al., 2013; Jneid et al., 2012). Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients who received aspirin within 24 hours before or after hospital arrival
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with a stroke shown to be non-haemorrhagic or a history of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) who have a record in the preceding 12 months that an anti-platelet agent or an anti-coagulant is being taken. Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the developed world. One quarter of stroke deaths occur under the age of 65. There is evidence that appropriate diagnosis and management can improve outcomes.  Long-term anti-platelet therapy reduces the risk of serious vascular events following a stroke by about a quarter. It is advised that anti-platelet therapy is prescribed for the secondary prevention of recurrent stroke and other vascular events in patients who have sustained an ischaemic cerebrovascular event.  The British National Formulary (BNF) (2011) makes the following recommendations:     "Following a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), long-term treatment with modified-release dipyridamole 200 mg twice daily in combination with aspirin 75 mg once daily is recommended. If patients are intolerant of aspirin, or it is contra-indicated, then modified-release dipyridamole alone is recommended. If patients are intolerant of dipyridamole, or it is contraindicated, then aspirin alone is recommended. Patients who are intolerant of both aspirin and dipyridamole should receive clopidogrel alone (unlicensed use).   Following an ischaemic stroke (not associated with atrial fibrillation [AF]  see below), long-term treatment with clopidogrel 75 mg once daily is recommended. If clopidogrel is contraindicated or not tolerated, patients should receive modified-release dipyridamole 200 mg twice daily in combination with aspirin 75 mg once daily. If both aspirin and clopidogrel are contraindicated or not tolerated, then modified-release dipyridamole alone is recommended. If both dipyridamole and clopidogrel are contraindicated or not tolerated, than aspirin alone is recommended."     It is advised that patients with stroke associated with AF are reviewed for long-term treatment with warfarin or an alternative anti-coagulant (see the Atrial Fibrillation indicator set).   Refer to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Technology Appraisal (TA 210), "Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular events (review of TA 90)," (2010) for further information. Patients with a stroke shown to be non-haemorrhagic or a history of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator who have a record in the preceding 12 months that an anti-platelet agent or an anti-coagulant is being taken 
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with venous thromboembolism (VTE) treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) who receive heparin treatment for at least five days after the initiation of warfarin therapy and until international normalized ratio (INR) is greater than or equal to 2.0 for two consecutive days.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to prevent progression or recurrence of thromboembolic disease.  It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year.  Heparin/fondaparinux should be continued for at least five days after the initiation of warfarin therapy and until international normalized ratio (INR) is greater than or equal to 2.0 for two consecutive days.  The anticoagulant effect of warfarin is delayed until clotting factors already circulating are cleared. Although Factor VII has a shorter half-life in the blood (six to seven hours), peak anticoagulant activity is delayed for up to 96 hours until factors with longer plasma half-lives (II, IX and X) have cleared.  A goal INR of 2.5 (range 2.0-3.0) is recommended for the treatment of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Number of patients age 18 years and older and with venous thromboembolism (VTE) treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH)  Number of patients age 18 years and older and with venous thromboembolism (VTE) treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) who receive heparin treatment for at least five days after the initiation of warfarin therapy and until international normalized ratio (INR) is greater than or equal to 2.0 for two consecutive days
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients in the health care system's cardiac rehabilitation program(s) who meet the specified performance measure criteria for adherence to preventive medications.  This performance measure is one of ten individual submeasures of the measure subset, Individualized Patient Assessment and Evaluation of Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Development of Individual Interventions, and Communication with Other Healthcare Providers.The use of preventive medications that may or may not be tied to a specific risk factor (aspirin, omega-3 fatty acids, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blocker agents, for instance) are also critically important in reducing recurrent cardiovascular events in patients enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program. A gap in their usage is common, but can be corrected with the help of systematic programs, such as CR programs, that can promote the appropriate use of preventive medications and thereby improve patient outcomes. Number of patients in the healthcare system's cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program(s) Number of patients in the healthcare system's cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program(s) who meet the performance measure for adherence to preventive medications (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter in whom assessment of all of the specified thromboembolic risk factors using the CHADS2 risk criteria is documented. Assessment of thromboembolic risk and discussion of the potential benefits and risks of anticoagulant therapy are crucial steps in the evaluation and management of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter. Identification of factors that increase risk warrants consideration of chronic anticoagulant therapy. Individual risk varies over time, so the need for anticoagulation must be re-evaluated at regular intervals in all patients with AF or atrial flutter.  The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society (ACCF/AHA/HRS) 2011 Focused Update on the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (Update on Dabigatran)  Dabigatran is useful as an alternative to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism in patients with paroxysmal to permanent AF and risk factors for stroke or systemic embolization who do not have a prosthetic heart valve or hemodynamically significant valve disease, severe renal failure (creatinine clearance less than 15 mL/min) or advanced liver disease (impaired baseline clotting function).  2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC) Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation  Preventing Thromboembolism  (Recommendations regarding antithrombotic therapy other than those listed below pertain to patients with AF or atrial flutter undergoing cardioversion)        Antithrombotic therapy to prevent thromboembolism is recommended for all patients with AF, except those with lone AF or contraindications.       The selection of the antithrombotic agent should be based upon the absolute risks of stroke and bleeding and the relative risk and benefit for a given patient.       Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist is recommended for patients with more than one moderate risk factor. Such factors include age 75 years or greater, hypertension, heart failure (HF), impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function (ejection fraction 35% or less or fractional shortening less than 25%), and diabetes mellitus.       Antithrombotic therapy is recommended for patients with atrial flutter as for those with AF.    All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients in whom assessment of all of the specified thromboembolic risk factors using the CHADS2 risk criteria is documented (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke with dehydration who receive intravenous (IV) fluids.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of stroke patients age 18 years and over who receive appropriate medical management within the initial 24 to 48 hours of diagnosis for prevention of complications such as:        Dehydration       Aspiration       Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia       Deep vein thrombosis       Immobility       Falling       Nutritional status decline       Hyperthermia     Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  In the general medical management of patients with stroke, it is important to administer adequate fluids to avoid the development of dehydration and to treat it when present since dehydration with relative hypotension and hemoconcentration may impair cerebral blood flow. Dehydration with hemoconcentration may also increase the risk of thrombus formation and recurrent embolization in cardiogenic stroke. Therefore, it is suggested that isotonic intravenous fluids be administered to not only those admitted with dehydration or at risk for dehydration due to problems with swallowing, but to all stroke patients. Number of patients presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke and dehydration (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients who receive intravenous (IV) fluids
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients undergoing procedures for which venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is indicated in all patients who had an order for low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), adjusted-dose warfarin, fondaparinux or mechanical prophylaxis within 24 hours prior to incision time or within 24 hours after surgery end time.This measure addresses venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk based on surgical procedure. VTE prophylaxis is appropriate for all patients undergoing these procedures regardless of individual patient thromboembolic risk factors.*  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  Recommend that mechanical methods of prophylaxis be used primarily in patients who are at high risk of bleeding or as an adjunct to anticoagulant-based prophylaxis.  Recommend against the use of aspirin alone as prophylaxis against VTE for any patient group.  Recommend consideration of renal impairment when deciding on doses of low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, the direct thrombin inhibitors, and other antithrombotic drugs that are cleared by the kidneys, particularly in elderly patients and those who are at high risk for bleeding.  Moderate-risk general surgery patients are those patients undergoing a nonmajor procedure and are between the ages of 40 and 60 years or have additional risk factors, or those patients who are undergoing major operations and are less than 40 years of age with no additional risk factors. Recommend prophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), 5,000 U bid or LMWH less than or equal to 3,400 U once daily.  Higher-risk general surgery patients are those undergoing nonmajor surgery and are greater than 60 years of age or have additional risk factors, or patients undergoing major surgery who are greater than 40 years of age or have additional risk factors. Recommend thromboprophylaxis with LDUH, 5,000 U tid or LMWH, greater than 3,400 U daily.  Recommend that thromboprophylaxis be used in all major gynecologic surgery patients.  For patients undergoing major, open urologic procedures, recommend routine prophylaxis with LDUH twice daily or three times daily.  Patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, which includes hip and knee arthroplasty and hip fracture repair, represent a group that is at particularly high risk for VTE, and routine thromboprophylaxis has been the standard of care for greater than 15 years. Elective total hip replacement: routine use of LMWH, fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose VKA. Elective total knee arthroplasty: routine thromboprophylaxis using LMWH, fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose VKA. Hip fracture surgery: routine use of fondaparinux, LMWH, adjusted-dose VKA, or LDUH.  For major orthopedic surgical procedures, recommend that a decision about the timing of the initiation of pharmacologic prophylaxis be based on the efficacy-to-bleeding tradeoffs for that particular agent. For LMWH, there are only small differences between starting preoperatively or postoperatively, both options acceptable.  Recommend that thromboprophylaxis be routinely used in patients undergoing major neurosurgery. (American College of Chest Physicians [ACCP]) All surgical patients aged 18 years and older undergoing procedures for which venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is indicated in all patients (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Surgical patients who had an order for low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), adjusted-dose warfarin, fondaparinux or mechanical prophylaxis to be given within 24 hours prior to incision time or within 24 hours after surgery end time (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period for whom there are documented results of an evaluation of level of activity AND an evaluation of presence or absence of anginal symptoms in the medical record.  Note: This measure and the Symptom Management measure (see the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse [NQMC] summary Chronic stable coronary artery disease: percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period and with results of an evaluation of level of activity AND an evaluation of presence or absence of anginal symptoms, with appropriate management of anginal symptoms [evaluation of level of activity and symptoms includes no report of anginal symptoms OR evaluation of level of activity and symptoms includes report of anginal symptoms and a plan of care is documented to achieve control of anginal symptoms]) address related aspects of care for effective assessment and management of symptoms for a patient with chronic stable coronary artery disease. The intent of these measures is that they be utilized as a pair, as the results of the Symptom  Activity Assessment provide the basis of decisions that are made in the Symptom Management measure. It is not recommended that either of these measures be used independently. The pairing of these measures is not intended to suggest the use of any particular scoring methodology (i.e., a composite score), nor does it imply either equality of difference in the relative "weights" of the two measures. A performance score for each measure should be reported individually.   The National Quality Forum (NQF) provides definitions of paired and composite measures:        Paired measures are individual measures that should be measured concurrently in the same population; however, the results are not combined into a single score (e.g., measuring mortality and readmission and displaying them togetherbut not calculating a joint score).       A composite measure is a combination of two or more individual measures in a single measure that results in a single score.   In order to effectively manage the symptoms of a patient with chronic stable coronary artery disease, an assessment of those symptoms needs to be performed. This assessment is the basis of any treatment modification that needs to be made. Effective management of the symptoms associated with chronic stable coronary artery disease (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath) may lead to improved patient quality of life which is an important, patient-centered outcome.  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  The treatment of chronic stable angina has two complementary objectives: to reduce the risk of mortality and morbid events and to reduce symptoms. From the patient's perspective, it is often the latter that is of greater concern. The cardinal symptom of [coronary artery disease (CAD)] is anginal chest pain or equivalent symptoms, such as exertional dyspnea. Often the patient suffers not only from discomfort of the symptom itself but also from accompanying limitations on activities and the associated anxiety that the symptoms may produce. (Serves as a basis for treatment modification.) All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients for whom there are documented results of an evaluation of level of activity AND an evaluation of presence or absence of anginal symptoms in the medical record (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients in the healthcare system's cardiac rehabilitation program(s) who meet the specified performance measure criteria for assessment of weight management.  This performance measure is one of ten individual submeasures of the measure subset, Individualized Patient Assessment and Evaluation of Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Development of Individual Interventions, and Communication with Other Healthcare Providers.Obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and adversely affects CVD risk factors. By adhering to diet and lifestyle recommendations, patients can substantially reduce their risk of CVD.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with peripheral arterial disease in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg or less.Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is one of the three main categories of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and patients with PAD, including those who are asymptomatic, have an increased risk of mortality from CVD due to myocardial infarction and stroke. The relative risks of all-cause mortality are two to three times that of age and sex matched to groups without PAD.  Treatment of PAD focuses on cardiovascular risk factor management. Smoking is a very important risk factor for PAD and management of PAD includes smoking cessation (see smoking indicator set). Other established risk factors are high blood pressure and diabetes. This would mean that patients with PAD and high blood pressure would also be included in the hypertension indicator set and patients with diabetes and PAD would also be included in the diabetes indicator set.  The intent of the PAD indicators is to improve the identification and management of PAD and ensure all patients, including those without established risk factors already covered in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), are managed for their cardiovascular risk.  Refer to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline 147, "Lower limb peripheral arterial disease" (2012), for further information.  Most cases of PAD are managed in primary care. The focus of treatment is on the cardiovascular complications of atherosclerosis (managing cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure). Two small UK studies assessing clinical risk management based on the patient records of patients with PAD (Bradley  Kirker, 2006; Khan et al., 2007) suggest that these patients have poor hypertension control, use low levels of statin and anti-platelet therapy and receive low levels of smoking cessation advice. This indicator addresses the issue of blood pressure control.  Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) clinical guideline 89 (2006) recommends that hypertensive patients with PAD receive treatment to reduce their blood pressure. The guideline developers noted that treatment of PAD has often been considered difficult because of concerns that anti-hypertensive drugs, especially beta-blockers, may have adverse effects on PAD (for example, possible drug-induced peripheral vasoconstriction leading to further ischaemia in the leg). The developers did not find any strong evidence to suggest that beta-blockers should not be used in the presence of PAD, although no study was sufficiently large to demonstrate an absence of adverse effects with certainty.  Recommendation 2.6 in the guideline does not specify a target blood pressure in patients with PAD. However, the guideline developers considered that 140/90 mmHg is a desirable upper limit and that around one third to one half of patients with PAD would be considered hypertensive above this level.  The NICE clinical guideline on hypertension (2011) sets blood pressure thresholds for the initiation of drug treatment of hypertension and these are outlined within the rationale for the hypertension indicator set. All patients aged 79 or under with CVD and stage 1 hypertension (clinic blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg or higher and subsequent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring [ABPM] daytime average or home blood pressure monitoring [HBPM] average blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg or higher) are recommended drug therapy for hypertension.  The NICE guideline recommends a target clinic blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg in patients aged 79 or under with treated hypertension and a clinic blood pressure below 150/90 mmHg in patients aged 80 or over with treated hypertension.  For the purpose of QOF, a measurement of 150/90 mmHg has been adopted for this indicator.  Health economic modelling of PAD and the costs and consequences of treating high blood pressure over a patient's lifetime suggests that this treatment is a cost-effective use of National Health Service (NHS) resources. Patients with peripheral arterial disease (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg or less
This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult hospitalized patients 18 years and older receiving heparin therapy for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis who have a baseline platelet count before starting heparin and then a platelet count every other day over the course of 14 days.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to reduce the risk of complications from pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for hospitalized and discharged patients 18 years of age and older. Number of adult patients who are hospitalized for a medical condition or surgery and receiving heparin therapy for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of adult patients hospitalized for a medical condition or surgery and on heparin therapy for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis who have a baseline platelet count before starting heparin and then a platelet count every other day over the course of 14 days
This measure is used to determine the percentage of failures in monitoring of ischemia time and pressure in surgical procedures using pneumatic tourniquet.Ischemic neuromuscular injury may occur if the pneumatic tourniquet remains inflated too long. Direct pressure injury to nerves may also occur. Additionally, tourniquet inflation and deflation may depress the cardiorespiratory function in the perioperative period, including causing "showers" of embolic debris to the heart, which may in turn cause pulmonary embolism.    Main aim of indicator: to improve control of ischemia in surgical procedures.   Number of patients undergoing surgical procedures with pneumatic tourniquet-induced ischemia Number of failures in recording of time and pressure of pneumatic tourniquet x 100
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with a current diagnosis of heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction who are currently treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).Heart failure (HF) represents the only major cardiovascular disease with increasing prevalence and is responsible for dramatic impairment of quality of life, carries a poor prognosis for patients and is very costly for the National Health Service (NHS) to treat (second only to stroke). This indicator set refers to all patients with HF unless specified otherwise.  There is strong clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence to support the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) in all patients with HF with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). ACE-I improve symptoms, reduce the hospitalisation rate and improve the survival rate. This is applicable in all age groups. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are also effective in the treatment of patients with HF due to LVSD, but may only be used in patients intolerant of ACE-I.  It is possible to have a diagnosis of LVSD without HF, for example, asymptomatic people who might be identified coincidently but who are at high risk of developing subsequent HF. In such cases, ACE-Is delay the onset of symptomatic HF, reduce cardiovascular events and improve long-term survival. This indicator only applies to patients with HF and therefore excludes this other group of patients who are nevertheless to be considered for treatment with ACE-I.  National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline CG108 (2010) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) clinical guideline 95 (2007) recommend that ACE-I is used as first-line therapy in all patients with HF due to LVSD and that ARBs are used only in patients who are intolerant of ACE-I. Patients with a current diagnosis of heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator who are currently treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) 
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy who had a dilated macular or fundus exam performed with documented communication to the physician who manages the on-going care of the patient with diabetes mellitus regarding the findings of the macular or fundus exam at least once within 12 months.The physician that manages the on-going care of the patient with diabetes should be aware of the patient's dilated eye examination and severity of retinopathy to manage the on-going diabetes care. Such communication is important in assisting the physician to better manage the diabetes. Several studies have shown that better management of diabetes is directly related to lower rates of development of diabetic eye disease (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial - DCCT, UK Prospective Diabetes Study - UKPDS).*  *The following clinical recommendation statement is quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represents the evidence base for the measure:  While it is clearly the responsibility of the ophthalmologist to manage eye disease, it is also the ophthalmologist's responsibility to ensure that patients with diabetes are referred for appropriate management of their systemic condition. It is the realm of the patient's family physician, internist or endocrinologist to manage the systemic diabetes. The ophthalmologist should communicate with the attending physician. (American Academy of Ophthalmology [AAO]) All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy who had a dilated macular or fundus exam performed (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients with documentation, at least once within 12 months of the findings of the dilated macular or fundus exam via communication to the physician who manages the patient's diabetic care (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients who have ischemic vascular disease (IVD) with optimally managed modifiable risk factors:        Blood pressure less than 140/90 mmHg       Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) less than 100 mg/dl       Daily aspirin use       Documented tobacco-free status   According to the Minnesota Department of Health, vascular disease is a high impact clinical condition in Minnesota. More than 20% of all deaths in Minnesota are due to heart disease and more than 7% are due to stroke, making them the second and third leading causes of death, respectively, in the state behind cancer. Inpatient hospitalization charges alone in Minnesota were $1.7 billion for heart disease patients and $318 million for stroke patients in 2007. According to the American Heart Association, more than 81 million Americans (37%) have cardiovascular disease. In every year since 1900 (except the 1918 influenza pandemic), cardiovascular disease accounted for more deaths than any other major cause of death in the United States. In 2006, cardiovascular disease claimed one of every 2.9 deaths in the United States. Eligible patients age 18 to 75 with a diagnosis of ischemic vascular disease (IVD) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) The number of ischemic vascular disease (IVD) patients who met all of the following targets for optimally managed modifiable risk factors:        The most recent low-density lipoprotein (LDL) test in the measurement period has a value less than 100.       The most recent blood pressure in the measurement period has a systolic value of less than 140 and a diastolic value of less than 90 (BOTH values must be less than).       There is documentation in the chart that the patient is currently a non-tobacco user.       There is documentation in the measurement period that the patient is on daily aspirin or anti-platelet medication OR there is documentation of an accepted contraindication (any date).

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of venous ulcer who received education regarding the need for long term compression therapy including interval replacement of compression stockings within the 12 month reporting period.Venous ulcers often recur, especially in patients who are not compliant with compression therapy, with rates as high as 70%. "Numerous investigators have found that compliance is dependent on patient access to compression stockings and appropriate education." As a result, long term maintenance including the continued appropriate use of compression therapy must be addressed through patient education.  The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  Part of any prevention program must be patient education. This education should include the patient's individual skin care program, moisturizers, soaps and protective measures. The patient should be educated about the long term nature of this medical condition and the signs and symptoms of recurrence. There are many therapeutic modalities that have been shown to reduce the recurrence of lower extremity wounds includ[ing] graduated compression stockings (GCS) for patients with venous hypertension or at risk for venous insufficiency disease. (American Society of Plastic Surgeons [ASPS], 2007)  Patients with healed or surgically repaired venous ulcers should use compression stockings constantly and forever. (Wound Healing Society [WHS], 2006)  Compression stockings or other compression devices must be worn for the prevention of venous edema and venous leg ulcer recurrence. It is recommended that patients understand that compression therapy is needed for the rest of their lives [including the need to] apply compression stockings upon first rising in the morning, replace stockings regularlyabout every 3 monthsto provide optimal compression, have someone correctly measure stockings, which should include ankle circumference, length of leg from foot to knee, and midcalf circumference. These measurements should be done in the morning before edema occurs. Knee-length stockings are generally recommended. (Wound, Ostomy, and Continence Nurses Society [WOCN], 2005)  Compression, elevation, ambulation post healing [are recommended] to prevent recurrence. (Association for the Advancement of Wound Care [AAWC], 2005) All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of venous ulcer    Note: Refer to the original measure documentation for administrative codes. Patients who received education regarding the need for long term compression therapy including interval replacement of compression stockings within the 12 month reporting period    Note: Refer to the original measure documentation for administrative codes.
This measure is used to assess the percentage of acute coronary patients with acute renal failure (ARF).The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.   The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.  Acute renal failure (ARF) is a rare complication in acute coronary patients; however, when it develops it doubles the probability of death. ARF also increases the use of intensive care unit (ICU) resources. Total number of acute coronary patients discharged from the critical care department (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of acute coronary patients with acute renal failure (ARF) (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients in the healthcare system's cardiac rehabilitation program(s) who meet the specified performance measure criteria for physical activity habits.  This performance measure is one of ten individual submeasures of the measure subset, Individualized Patient Assessment and Evaluation of Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Development of Individual Interventions, and Communication with Other Healthcare Providers.Adherence to regular physical activity has been associated with a 20% to 30% reduction in all-causes mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD).

This measure is used to assess the time (in minutes) from emergency department (ED) arrival to administration of fibrinolytic therapy in ED patients 18 years and older with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed closest to ED arrival and prior to transfer.  The median time to fibrinolysis should be analyzed in conjunction with the measure rate for fibrinolysis received within 30 minutes of ED arrival (OP-2). These measures, used together, will assist in understanding the median time to fibrinolysis and will identify the number of AMI patients who are receiving fibrinolysis within 30 minutes of ED arrival and potential opportunities for improvement to decrease the median time to fibrinolysis. See the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summary of the CMS OP-2 measure Acute myocardial infarction (AMI): percentage of ED patients with AMI and ST-segment elevation or LBBB on the ECG closest to arrival time receiving fibrinolytic therapy during the ED stay and having a time from ED arrival to fibrinolysis of 30 minutes or less. Time to fibrinolytic therapy is a strong predictor of outcome in patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Nearly 2 lives per 1,000 patients are lost per hour of delay (Fibrinolytic Therapy Trialists' Collaborative Group, 1994). National guidelines recommend that fibrinolytic therapy be given within 30 minutes of hospital arrival in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (Antman et al., 2008). Patients 18 years and older with an emergency department (ED) encounter who were discharged/transferred to a short-term general hospital for inpatient care, or to a Federal healthcare facility, with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed closest to ED arrival, and who received fibrinolytic therapy (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Continuous variable statement: Time (in minutes) from emergency department (ED) arrival to administration of fibrinolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with and ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed closest to ED arrival and prior to transfer
This measure is used to assess the percentage of hypertensive patients age 18 years and older with a home blood pressure monitoring device who have been educated in the correct technique for blood pressure measurement and monitoring.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to improve the assessment of hypertensive patients age 18 and older.  Approximately 30% of the adult population in the United States has hypertension. The majority of people over 65 years of age carry this diagnosis. Therefore, approximately 66.9 million people in the United States carry the diagnosis of hypertension. It is estimated that this number will rise as the number of patients who are over the age of 65, as well as the number of patients who are obese, continue to increase.  Hypertension is the most common reason for adult office visits other than pregnancy and has the highest use of prescription drugs. Despite the number of resources used to treat this disease, only about 50% of hypertensives have their blood pressure under control using the definition of blood pressure less than 140/90.  Poor adherence to lifestyle changes and medication contribute to this poor outcome. Lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, weight loss, increased exercise and limiting alcohol abuse are difficult when there are no symptoms of the disease until secondary problems arise. It is also difficult to continue medications when drug-related side effects arise when the disease itself is asymptomatic. Inadequate access to medical care for chronic disease, as well as the cost of medication, contribute to poor control of blood pressure.  Out-of-office, self-measured blood pressure readings provide important information regarding the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension and should be a routine component of diagnosis and monitoring. Home blood pressure monitoring identifies patients with white-coat hypertension, i.e., patients with elevated office blood pressure who lack evidence of hypertensive target organ damage and who have normal out-of-office blood pressure readings, and home readings are a stronger predictor of subsequent cardiovascular events than are office readings. Moreover, home blood pressure measurements can identify patients with "masked hypertension," i.e., normal office and elevated home readings. Studies have shown that uncertainty about the "true blood pressure" is a common reason for lack of change in treatment during a clinic visit despite an elevated office blood pressure reading. Additional readings from self-monitoring will reduce this uncertainty. Number of patients age 18 years and older and with hypertension who have a home blood pressure monitoring device (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients age 18 years and older and with hypertension who have been educated in the correct technique for blood pressure measurement and monitoring (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the age-standardized rate of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery performed on inpatients in acute care hospitals or percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) performed on patients in acute care hospitals, same day surgery facilities or catheterization laboratories per 100,000 population age 20 years and over.Cardiac revascularization procedures are used to restore or improve blood supply to the heart muscle, which reduces the symptoms of coronary heart disease, such as chest pain and weakness. Revascularization can improve the quality of patients' lives and reduce mortality.  The choice of revascularization mode (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]) depends on numerous factors including physician preferences, availability of services, and referral patterns, as well as differences in population health and socio-economic status. The combined cardiac revascularization rate represents total activity of cardiac revascularization in a jurisdiction. Total mid-year population age 20 and older Total number of discharges for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients age 20 and older (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of hospitalized patients 18 years and older on prescribed heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin who have appropriate baseline laboratory tests documented.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to improve the safety of using medications by reducing the likelihood of patient harm associated with the use of anticoagulation therapy in inpatient care settings for patients 18 years of age and older. Number of adult patients who are hospitalized for a medical condition or surgery prescribed heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of adult patients hospitalized for a medical condition or surgery and on heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin who have appropriate baseline laboratory tests documented
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients in the health care system's cardiac rehabilitation program(s) who meet the specified performance measure criteria for depression.  This performance measure is one of ten individual submeasures of the measure subset, Individualized Patient Assessment and Evaluation of Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Development of Individual Interventions, and Communication with Other Healthcare Providers.Depression is highly prevalent among patients following acute cardiac events, with 20% to 45% of patients suffering significant levels of depressive symptoms after an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Depression has been shown to be a powerful, independent risk factor for cardiac mortality after an acute MI or unstable angina. Several studies suggest that depressed patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefit from cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs by improving coping skills and self-image, reducing biological risk factors such as social isolation and smoking, providing emotional support, and improving quality-of-life scores.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of calendar months during the reporting period during which patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter, receiving warfarin therapy, have at least one international normalized ratio (INR) measurement made.Frequent monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) level is essential to guiding warfarin dose adjustment to maintain anticoagulation intensity in the desired target range. More frequent monitoring may be required during initiation of warfarin therapy or when other drugs that interact with warfarin are started or stopped.  The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC) Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation  Monitoring of INR        Antithrombotic therapy to prevent thromboembolism is recommended for all patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), except those with lone AF or contraindications.       The selection of the antithrombotic agent should be based upon the absolute risks of stroke and bleeding and the relative risk and benefit for a given patient.       Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist is recommended for patients with more than one moderate risk factor. Such factors include age 75 years or greater, hypertension, heart failure (HF), impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function (ejection fraction 35% or less or fractional shortening less than 25%), and diabetes mellitus.       For patients without mechanical heart valves at high risk of stroke, chronic oral anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin K antagonist is recommended in a dose adjusted to achieve the target intensity INR of 2.0 to 3.0, unless contraindicated. Factors associated with highest risk for stroke in patients with AF are prior thromboembolism (stroke, transient ischemic attack [TIA], or systemic embolism) and rheumatic mitral stenosis.       INR should be determined at least weekly during initiation of therapy and monthly when anticoagulation is stable.       Aspirin, 81 to 325 mg daily, is recommended as an alternative to vitamin K antagonists in low-risk patients or in those with contraindications to oral anticoagulation.       Antithrombotic therapy is recommended for patients with atrial flutter as for those with AF.    Number of calendar months in which the patient aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter received warfarin therapy (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of calendar months in which at least one international normalized ratio (INR) measurement was made (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patient visits for those patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure and with quantitative results of an evaluation of both level of activity AND clinical symptoms documented in which patient symptoms have improved or remained consistent with treatment goals since last assessment OR patient symptoms have demonstrated clinically important deterioration since last assessment with a documented plan of care.Heart failure is a chronic condition that poses a major and growing threat to the public's health. Improving the effectiveness of care and optimizing patient outcomes will become increasingly important as the population of the United States ages.  Decreasing symptoms and improving function are two of the primary goals of heart failure treatment and represent important patient-centric outcomes for heart failure care. The results of an ongoing assessment of patient symptoms and their functional consequences allow for the continuous monitoring of the effects of treatment and serve as the basis for making treatment modifications.   The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  [The] ongoing review of the patients clinical status is critical to the appropriate selection and monitoring of treatments.  the severity of symptoms characteristically fluctuates even in the absence of changes in medications, and changes in medications and diet can have either favorable or adverse effects on functional capacity in the absence of measurable changes in ventricular function. Some patients may demonstrate remarkable recovery, sometimes associated with improvement in structural and functional abnormalities. Usually, sustained improvement is associated with drug therapy, and that therapy should be continued indefinitely.  In patients with serious illness at the end of life, clinicians should regularly assess patients for pain, dyspnea, and depression.  Options for end-of-life care should be discussed with the patient and family when severe symptoms in patients with refractory end-stage heart failure persist despite application of all recommended therapies.  Patients with refractory end-stage heart failure and implantable defibrillators should receive information about the option to inactivate the defibrillator.  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of [heart failure] and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), unless contraindicated.  Treatment with an [ACE inhibitor] should be initiated at low doses [see excerpt from guideline table below], followed by gradual increments in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated Clinicians should attempt to use doses that have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events inclinical trials. If these target doses of an [ACE inhibitor] cannot be used or are poorly tolerated, intermediate doses should be used with the expectation that there are likely to be only small differences in efficacy between low and high doses.   Use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (i.e., bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all stable patients with current or prior symptoms of [heart failure] and reduced LVEF, unless contraindicated.  Treatment with a beta blocker should be initiated at very low doses, followed by gradual increments in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated physicians, especially cardiologists and primary care physicians, should make every effort to achieve the target doses of the beta blockers shown to be effective in major clinical trials.  Angiotensin II receptor blockers are recommended in patients with current or prior symptoms of [heart failure] and reduced LVEF who are [ACE inhibitor]-intolerant.  Diuretics and salt restriction are indicated in patients with current or prior symptoms of [heart failure] and reduced LVEF who have evidence of fluid retention.  Exercise training is beneficial as an adjunctive approach to improve clinical status in ambulatory patients with current or prior symptoms of [heart failure] and reduced LVEF.  Referral for cardiac transplantation in potentially eligible patients is recommended for patients with refractory end-stage [heart failure].  Decisions to initiate palliative care at the end of life should be individualized on the basis of patient symptoms and preferences.   Multidisciplinary disease-management programs for patients at high risk for hospital admission or clinical deterioration are recommended to facilitate the implementation of practice guidelines, to attack different barriers to behavioral change, and to reduce the risk of subsequent hospitalization for [heart failure]. All patient visits for those patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure and with quantitative results of an evaluation of both level of activity AND clinical symptoms documented (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patient visits in which patient symptoms have improved or remained consistent with treatment goals since last assessment OR patient symptoms have demonstrated clinically important deterioration since last assessment with a documented plan of care (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (or caregiver[s], as appropriate) who were queried about symptoms of autonomic dysfunction (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, constipation, urinary urgency/incontinence and fecal incontinence, urinary retention requiring catheterization, or persistent erectile failure) at least annually.Autonomic dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and manifests most commonly as orthostatic hypotension (45%), constipation (70%), urinary dysfunction (40%), and erectile dysfunction (55%). These symptoms can be disabling. Orthostasis can lead to syncope and secondary injury and may be the result of disease or therapy. Adjustments in medications or addition of pressor agents can be very effective in treating this problem. Constipation may be the result of medication (particularly anticholinergics or amantadine) or disease. The extreme effect may be bowel obstruction, which is extremely serious. This manifestation should be treated aggressively. Urinary difficulties are disabling (preventing patients from leaving home) and embarrassing to patients and include increased frequency, urgency, incomplete emptying, and obstruction. These difficulties could be due to medications (anticholinergics or amantadine), PD, or other ailments afflicting the elderly. Proper referral to a urologist would be important. Erectile dysfunction may be medication- or disease-related and could be addressed with medication adjustment or consultation with urology. Addressing these issues will have a large impact on morbidity and mortality and prevent hospitalizations. This would, in turn, reduce costs of caring for PD patients.*  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  Determining the presence of the following clinical features in early stages of disease should be considered to distinguish PD from other parkinsonian syndromes: 1) falls at presentation and early in the disease course, 2) poor response to levodopa, 3) symmetry at onset, 4) rapid progression (to Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 in 3 years), 5) lack of tremor, and 6) dysautonomia (urinary urgency/incontinence and fecal incontinence, urinary retention requiring catheterization, persistent erectile failure, or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension). (Level B) (AAN QSS PD, Apr 2006)  People with PD should be treated appropriately for the following autonomic disturbances: urinary dysfunction; weight loss; dysphagia; constipation; erectile dysfunction; orthostatic hypotension; excessive sweating; sialorrhoea. (Level D) (NICE GL35, Jun 2006)  All veterans with PD should be reassessed for complications of PD (including, but not limited to functional status, excessive daytime somnolence, speech and swallowing difficulties, dementia, depression, and psychosis) at least on an annual basis. (Cheng #10 [Reassessment for complications for PD], 2004) All patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients (or caregiver[s], as appropriate) who were queried about symptoms of autonomic dysfunction (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, constipation, urinary urgency/incontinence and fecal incontinence, urinary retention requiring catheterization, or persistent erectile failure) at least annually (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with a diagnosis of heart failure (diagnosed on or after 1 April 2006) which has been confirmed by an echocardiogram or by specialist assessment 3 months before or 12 months after entering on to the register.Heart failure (HF) represents the only major cardiovascular disease with increasing prevalence and is responsible for dramatic impairment of quality of life, carries a poor prognosis for patients and is very costly for the National Health Service (NHS) to treat (second only to stroke). This indicator set refers to all patients with HF unless specified otherwise.  This indicator requires that all patients with suspected HF are investigated (Senni et al., 1999) and this is expected to involve, as a minimum, further specialist investigation (such as echocardiography) and often specialist opinion. Serum natriuretic peptides can be used to determine whether patients with clinically suspected HF need a referral for echocardiography and their use is recommended as below. Specialists may include general practitioners (GPs) identified by NHS England as having a special interest in HF. Many HF patients will be diagnosed following specialist referral or during hospital admission and some will also have their diagnosis confirmed by tests such as cardiac scintography or angiography rather than echocardiography.  Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance (2010, 2011) recommends that patients with suspected HF receive both echocardiography and specialist assessment. The guidance also recommends that serum natriuretic peptides are measured in patients with suspected HF without previous myocardial infarction (MI). Patients with suspected HF who have had a previous MI or who have very high levels of serum natriuretic peptide are considered to require urgent referral due to their poor prognosis. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) clinical guideline on the management of chronic HF (2007) recommends that echocardiography is performed in patients with suspected HF who have either a raised serum natriuretic peptide or abnormal electrocardiograph result to confirm the diagnosis and establish the underlying cause. Patients with a diagnosis of heart failure (diagnosed on or after 1 April 2006) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator whose diagnosis has been confirmed by an echocardiogram or by specialist assessment 3 months before or 12 months after entering on to the register
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is a procedure that requires technical proficiency with the use of complex equipment. Technical errors may lead to clinically significant complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and death.   The frequency of CABG has been relatively stable over the past 15 years, as percutaneous coronary interventions have become more popular. Approximately 366,000 CABG were performed in the USA in 1997 (13.5 per 10,000 persons). Approximately 427,000 CABG were performed in the USA in 2004 (14.6 per 10,000 persons). States (CA, MA, NJ, NY, PA) which publish hospital-specific report cards for CABG performed significantly fewer (p=0.05) procedures (113.8  31.8 per million capita) than non-reporting states (152  62.6 per million capita).   Hospital discharge practices differ, with some hospitals discharging patients earlier than others. For this reason, this indicator should be considered in conjunction with length of stay and transfer rates (though transfers are excluded in this indicator). While inpatient and 30-day mortality appear to be similar, providers may wish to track 30-day mortality if possible.  As with other mortality measures, there is concern that measuring mortality rates would result in access problems for higher risk patients. If possible, it may be useful to monitor the outcomes for CABG patients that do not undergo surgery. Chart review may also help to identify "best practices" to ensure real quality improvement.   Note: The following caveats affect the validity of the indicator:        Selection bias: This results when a substantial percentage of care for a condition is provided in the outpatient setting, so the subset of inpatient cases may be unrepresentative. Examination of outpatient care or emergency care data may help to reduce this in these cases. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.       Confounding bias: Patient characteristics may substantially affect the performance of the indicator; risk adjustment is recommended. The concern is has been demonstrated in the literature       Unclear construct: There is uncertainty or poor correlation with widely accepted process measures. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.       Easily manipulated: Use of the indicator may create perverse incentives to improve performance on the indicator without truly improving quality of care. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.    Discharges, age 40 years and older, with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure code (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of deaths among cases meeting the inclusion and exclusion rules for the denominator
This measure is used to assess the percent of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) who are prescribed an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) at hospital discharge. For purposes of this measure, LVSD is defined as chart documentation of a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% or a narrative description of left ventricular systolic (LVS) function consistent with moderate or severe systolic dysfunction.Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (Flather et al., 2000; Pfeffer et al., 1992; Torp-Pedersen  Kober, 1999; Yusuf et al., 1992). Clinical trials have also established angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy as an acceptable alternative to ACEI, especially in patients with heart failure and/or LVSD who are ACEI intolerant (Granger et al., 2003; Pfeffer et al., 2003). National guidelines strongly recommend ACEI for patients hospitalized with AMI who have either clinical heart failure or LVSD (O'Gara et al., 2013; Anderson et al., 2007). Guideline committees have also supported the inclusion of ARBs in performance measures for AMI (American College of Emergency Physicians et al., 2013; Anderson et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2011). Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients who are prescribed an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) at hospital discharge
This measure is used to assess the percentage of uncomplicated hypertensive patients age 18 through 60 years with blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg and on medication who have a change in pharmacological therapy (e.g., increase in dose of initial drug, change to a drug from another class or addition of a second drug from another class).The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of hypertensive patients age 18 and older not at a blood pressure goal who have a change in subsequent pharmacological therapy.  Approximately 30% of the adult population in the United States has hypertension. The majority of people over 65 years of age carry this diagnosis. Therefore, approximately 66.9 million people in the United States carry the diagnosis of hypertension. It is estimated that this number will rise as the number of patients who are over the age of 65, as well as the number of patients who are obese, continue to increase.  Hypertension is the most common reason for adult office visits other than pregnancy and has the highest use of prescription drugs. Despite the number of resources used to treat this disease, only about 50% of hypertensives have their blood pressure under control using the definition of blood pressure less than 140/90.  Poor adherence to lifestyle changes and medication contribute to this poor outcome. Lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, weight loss, increased exercise and limiting alcohol abuse are difficult when there are no symptoms of the disease until secondary problems arise. It is also difficult to continue medications when drug-related side effects arise when the disease itself is asymptomatic. Inadequate access to medical care for chronic disease, as well as the cost of medication, contribute to poor control of blood pressure. Number of uncomplicated hypertensive patients with blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg and on hypertension medication (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of uncomplicated hypertensive patients age 18 through 60 with blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg and on hypertension medication who have a change in pharmacological therapy (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients ages 18 to 75 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who achieve any or all of the following control criteria:      Glycated hemoglobin (HgbA1c) less than 8%      Most recent blood pressure measurement less than 140/90 mmHg      Tobacco free      Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with documented daily aspirin use (unless contraindicated)     Ages 40 to 75 years with T2DM and untreated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) greater than 70 mg/dL who are prescribed statin therapy      All of the above   This measure represents the composite rate. This measure should be calculated as both an individual component met and a composite (all components met at the same time) measure. See the "Basis for Disaggregation" field for details.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients ages 18 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are optimally managed. Due to the high percentage of the United States (U.S.) population that is diagnosed with diabetes and the effect diabetes has on other comorbidities, appropriate management will improve the patient's experience of care and the health of the population, reducing office visits, emergency department visits, and cardiovascular complications. Other related conditions will in turn reduce the total cost of care.  Appropriate medication management targeting glycemic control, hypertension, and lipid management is important for reducing morbidity and mortality, and improving long-term quality of life for patients diagnosed with T2DM. Lifestyle changes such as nutrition therapy, weight loss, increased exercise, and appropriate education and self-management strategies are pivotal to improved outcomes. Inadequate access to care for chronic disease management as well as the cost of medication can contribute to poor control of T2DM and associated cardiovascular risk factors. For most chronic diseases, including diabetes, the most efficient improvement strategy is to focus on a limited number of specific improvement goals. These may be based on observed gaps in care, potential clinical impact, cost considerations or other criteria (O'Connor, 2005). In T2DM, focusing on glycemic control, lipid control and blood pressure control is a strategy that has been shown to be effective in preventing up to 53% of heart attacks and strokes, the leading drivers of excess mortality and costs in adults with diabetes (Gaede et al., 2003). Number of patients ages 18 to 75 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients who achieve all of the following control criteria:      Glycated hemoglobin (A1c) less than 8%      Most recent blood pressure measurement less than 140/90 mmHg      Tobacco free      Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with documented daily aspirin use (unless contraindicated)      Ages 40 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with untreated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) greater than 70 mg/dL who are prescribed statin therapy  
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.This indicator captures how often a blood clot ends up in the lungs (pulmonary embolism [PE]) or in a large vein (deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) following an operation. Both PE and DVT are common complications that can be prevented through continuous in-hospital risk assessment and appropriate prophylactic treatments.   Among community hospitals in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, the risk-adjusted rate of this indicator was 7.33 per 1,000 eligible patients in 2008. About 12,647 of these adverse events are estimated to have occurred in United States community hospitals in 2008. An earlier version of this Patient Safety Indicator (PSI) (v2.1) had a risk-adjusted rate of 10.05 per 1,000 eligible patients in Veterans Affairs (VA) data from fiscal year (FY) 2004. International data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show substantial variation across countries, with a maximum rate of 14.59 per 1,000 eligible patients from the USA.  Cases from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample that were flagged by this PSI had 6.6% excess mortality, 5.4 days of excess hospitalization, and $21,709 in excess hospital charges, relative to carefully matched controls that were not flagged. This finding was confirmed in the VA hospital system, where cases that were flagged by this PSI had 6.1% excess mortality, 4.5-5.5 days of excess hospitalization, and $7,205-9,064 in excess hospital costs, relative to carefully matched controls that were not flagged. In another study based on State Inpatient Databases from seven states that permit linkage of serial hospitalizations, this indicator was associated with relative risk ratios of 1.35 for inpatient death, 1.28 for readmission within three months, and 1.25 for readmission within one month (after adjusting for age, gender, payer, comorbidities, and specific surgical Diagnosis-Related Groups [DRGs], and All Patient Refined-DRG [APR-DRG] severity levels).  All surgical discharges age 18 and older defined by specific Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) or Medicare Severity-DRGs (MS-DRGs) and an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for an operating room procedure (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Discharges among cases meeting the inclusion and exclusion rules for the denominator with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) in any secondary diagnosis field (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of type 2 diabetes patients age 18 years and older with a blood pressure reading of less than 140/85 mmHg.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of hypertensive patients age 18 and older whose blood pressure is in control.  Approximately 30% of the adult population in the United States has hypertension. The majority of people over 65 years of age carry this diagnosis. Therefore, approximately 66.9 million people in the United States carry the diagnosis of hypertension. It is estimated that this number will rise as the number of patients who are over the age of 65, as well as the number of patients who are obese, continue to increase.  Hypertension is the most common reason for adult office visits other than pregnancy and has the highest use of prescription drugs. Despite the number of resources used to treat this disease, only about 50% of hypertensives have their blood pressure under control using the definition of blood pressure less than 140/90.  Poor adherence to lifestyle changes and medication contribute to this poor outcome. Lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, weight loss, increased exercise and limiting alcohol abuse are difficult when there are no symptoms of the disease until secondary problems arise. It is also difficult to continue medications when drug-related side effects arise when the disease itself is asymptomatic. Inadequate access to medical care for chronic disease, as well as the cost of medication, contribute to poor control of blood pressure.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy who had a dilated macular or fundus exam performed which included documentation of the level of severity of retinopathy AND the presence or absence of macular edema during one or more office visits within 12 months.Several level 1 randomized control trial (RCT) studies demonstrate the ability of timely treatment to reduce the rate and severity of vision loss from diabetes (Diabetic Retinopathy Study-DRS, Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study-ETDRS). Necessary examination prerequisites to applying the study results are that the presence and severity of both peripheral diabetic retinopathy and macular edema be accurately documented. In the RAND chronic disease quality project, while administrative data indicated that roughly half of the patients had an eye exam in the recommended time period, chart review data indicated that only 19% had documented evidence of a dilated examination. Thus, ensuring timely treatment that could prevent 95% of the blindness due to diabetes requires the performance and documentation of key examination parameters. The documented level of severity of retinopathy and the documented presence or absence of macular edema assists with the on-going plan of care for the patient with diabetic retinopathy.*  *The following clinical recommendation statement is quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represents the evidence base for the measure:  Since treatment is effective in reducing the risk of visual loss, detailed examination is indicated to assess for the following features that often lead to visual impairment: presence of macular edema, optic nerve neovascularization and/or neovascularization elsewhere, signs of severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and vitreous or preretinal hemorrhage. (American Academy of Ophthalmology [AAO]) All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who had a dilated macular or fundus exam performed which included documentation of the level of severity of retinopathy AND the presence or absence of macular edema during one or more office visits within 12 months (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk greater than or equal to 10%, or diabetes and on lipid-lowering therapy who remain on lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy 12 months after therapy was prescribed.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk greater than or equal to 10%, or diabetes, and on lipid-lowering therapy who remain on the medication therapy.  Patients with risk factors for coronary heart disease but no history of disease who receive lipid-lowering therapy are likely to experience a decreased risk of coronary heart disease (Sever et al., 2003; "Major outcomes," 2002; Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group, 2002; Shepherd et al., 2002; Pignone, Phillips,  Mulrow, 2000; Downs et al., 1998; Shepherd et al., 1995; Frick et al., 1987; Lipid Research Clinics Program, 1984).  Patients with a history of coronary disease (including unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction) often benefit from treatment with a statin. Studies have consistently shown a decrease in risk of death from coronary heart disease (Cannon et al., 2004; Nissen et al., 2004; Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group, 2002; Shepherd et al., 2002; LaRosa, He,  Vupputuri, 1999; Goldberg et al., 1998; The Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) Study Group, 1998; Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study Group, 1994).  Poor adherence can limit the effectiveness of therapies. In asymptomatic conditions such as hyperlipidemia, this can be especially problematic. Long-term adherence to drug therapy for chronic conditions is estimated to be only about 50%. Adherence in clinical trials is often much higher, due to multiple factors including patient selection, close monitoring and educational efforts of medical staff. Patients with (a) established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), (b) 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk greater than or equal to 10%, or (c) diabetes and are prescribed lipid-lowering medication (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)  Patients who remain on pharmacotherapy 12 months after therapy was prescribed
The measure is used to assess the proportion of stroke patients in each risk-adjusted group, ages 16 years and older, that make at least one level of progress on the Memory Functional Communication Measure (FCM).    The Memory FCM is one of 15 FCM scales which are used to measure outcomes of speech and language therapy in the realm of swallowing and 14 areas of communication over time.  Each scale is composed of seven-point ratings ranging from least functional (level 1) to most functional (level 7).Changes in Functional Communication Measure (FCM) level provide information on the benefits of treatment designed to enhance functional communication and swallowing.  FCMs were designed to describe aspects of a patient's functional communication and swallowing abilities over time from admission to discharge in various speech-language pathology treatment settings. Stroke patients, ages 16 years and older, with a treatment plan recommending speech and language intervention for a minimum of two sessions. Patients must receive speech and language intervention using either an individual and/or group treatment model or a training and/or consultation model.  See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.

Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.The Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDI) function appropriately in pediatric populations to identify adverse events. This Quality Indicator (QI) evidenced the greatest total charges of the QIs but did not show excess length of stay.  California data from 2005 to 2007, which was used because it included present on admission data and allowed for hospital specific calculations, were used to determine the percentage of hospitals with appropriate patient volumes to readily use the QI for performance measurement. Only a few of the California hospitals (6%) could readily use this QI. The authors noted that the hospitals most likely to perform this procedure were able to use the QI; however, they noted the need to address this caveat in public reporting requirements.  The evidence for the validity of this indicator comes from two sources. First, three studies (including one that used prospectively collected clinical data) have reported an association between hospital volume and mortality following pediatric cardiac surgery. Using a multivariate model that included age, complexity category, and four comorbidities, Hannan et al. found 8.26% risk-adjusted mortality at hospitals with fewer than 100 cases per year, versus 5.95% at higher volume hospitals (an effect limited to surgeons who performed at least 75 cases per year). Two other studies using hospital discharge data from California and Massachusetts found similar effects of hospital volume. The consistent association between volume and risk-adjusted mortality supports the validity of both measures of performance, and is consistent with the hypothesis that more experience leads to improved technical skills and better outcomes. Other studies from single centers have confirmed this hypothesis by demonstrating improvements in mortality over time for a variety of procedures. The second source of evidence is that cardiopulmonary bypass or aortic crossclamp time has been repeatedly associated with postoperative mortality, adjusting for a variety of patient characteristics. This relationship has been demonstrated not just for the Fontan procedure, but also for the Norwood procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Experienced surgeons and surgical teams should be able to reduce cardiopulmonary bypass or aortic cross-clamp time, thereby improving postoperative mortality. It should be noted that patient-level reduction in mortality does not necessarily correspond with provider-level mortality. It is unknown how implementing these processes of care would actually affect provider-level mortality rates.  Discharges under age 18 with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure codes for congenital heart disease or non-specific heart surgery with ICD-9-CM diagnosis of congenital heart disease in any field (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of deaths among cases meeting the inclusion and exclusion rules for the denominator with a code of pediatric heart surgery with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis of congenital heart disease in any field (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with any or any combination of the following conditions: coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), asthma, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder or other psychoses whose notes record smoking status in the preceding 12 months.The aim of this domain is to increase the proportion of successful smoking quit attempts by providing the best available support and treatment. A wide range of diseases and conditions are caused by cigarette smoking, including cancers, respiratory diseases, coronary heart disease (CHD) and other circulatory diseases, stomach and duodenal ulcers, erectile dysfunction (ED) and infertility, osteoporosis, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration and periodontitis. Women who smoke during pregnancy are also at substantially higher risk of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) than those who do not smoke. Smoking can also cause complications in pregnancy and labour, including ectopic pregnancy, bleeding during pregnancy, premature detachment of the placenta and premature rupture of the membranes (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE], 2008). In 2011, 20 per cent of the adult population of Great Britain were cigarette smokers. The overall prevalence of smoking has been at approximately this level since 2007 (Office for National Statistics [ONS], 2011). Around 33 per cent of the population of England tried to stop in 2011, but only two to three per cent of the population succeed in stopping (West, 2011). Many of these attempts fail because they are made without treatment. There is good evidence to suggest that offering support and treatment is sufficient to motivate some smokers to attempt to stop who would not have done so with brief advice to quit alone. For example, a Cochrane review that included 132 trials of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), with over 40,000 people in the main analysis, found evidence that all forms of NRT made it more likely that a person's attempt to quit smoking would succeed. The chances of stopping smoking were increased by 50 to 70 per cent (Stead et al., 2008). National Health Service (NHS) Stop Smoking Services combine psychological support and medication. Results for April 2012 to March 2013 showed that 724,247 people who had contact with the service had set a quit date. Four weeks later, 373,872 people had successfully quit (based on self-report) representing half of those who set a quit date (The NHS Information Centre, 2013). 'An offer of support and treatment' means offering a referral or self-referral to a local NHS Stop Smoking Service adviser (who might be a member of the practice team) plus pharmacotherapy. Where such support is not acceptable to the patient, an alternative form of brief support, such as follow-up appointments with a general practitioner (GP) or practice nurse trained in smoking cessation, may be offered. The NICE public health guidance on smoking cessation (2008) states that healthcare professionals who advise on, or prescribe, NRT, varenicline or bupropion:      Offer NRT, varenicline or bupropion, as appropriate, to patients who are planning to stop smoking      Offer advice, encouragement and support, including referral to the NHS Stop Smoking Service, to help patients in their attempt to quit      When deciding which therapies to use and in which order, discuss the options with the client and take into account:              Whether a first offer of referral to the NHS Stop Smoking Service has been made          Contra-indications and the potential for adverse effects          The client's personal preferences          The availability of appropriate counselling or support          The likelihood that the client will follow the course of treatment          Their previous experience of smoking cessation aids             The guidance also states that managers and providers of NHS Stop Smoking Services:      Offer behavioural counselling, group therapy, pharmacotherapy, or a combination of treatments that have been proven to be effective      Ensure clients receive behavioural support from a person who has had training and supervision that complies with the "Standard for training in smoking cessation treatments" (Health Development Agency [HDA], 2003) or its updates      Provide tailored advice, counselling and support, particularly to clients from minority ethnic and disadvantaged groups      Provides services in the language chosen by clients, wherever possible.   NICE public health guidance also states that stop smoking advisers and other healthcare practitioners who advise on, supply, or prescribe, pharmacotherapies should encourage people who are already using an unlicensed nicotine-containing product (such as unlicensed electronic cigarettes) to switch to a licensed product (2013). Due to the potential for ex-smokers to resume smoking within three years of cessation, it is good clinical practice to ask patients with a history of smoking their current smoking status and offer treatment and advice where necessary. It is also good practice to ask and record the smoking status of newly registered patients and to offer support and treatment where necessary. Refer to NICE public health guidance 1, 10, 45 and 48 for more information. CHD Smoking is known to be associated with an increased risk of CHD. Refer to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) clinical guideline 97, "Risk estimation and the prevention of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (2007)," and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) European Guidelines "CVD Prevention in clinical practice (2007)," for further information. PAD PAD is associated with older age and with smoking. Cigarette smoking is a very important contributor to PAD and as such the management of PAD includes smoking cessation. Stroke or TIA There are few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the effects of risk factor modification in the secondary prevention of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. However, inferences can be drawn from the finds of primary prevention trials that cessation of cigarette smoking be advocated. Refer to SIGN clinical guideline 108, "Management of patients with stroke or TIA: assessment, investigation, immediate management and secondary prevention (2008)," for further information.  Hypertension There is no strong direct link between smoking and blood pressure. However, there is overwhelming evidence of the relationship between smoking and cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. The NICE clinical guideline on hypertension (2011) recommends that patients who smoke are offered advice and help to stop smoking. Diabetes The risk of vascular complications in patients with diabetes is substantially increased. Smoking is an established risk factor for cardiovascular and other diseases. COPD Smoking cessation is the single most effective and cost-effective intervention to reduce the risk of developing COPD and stop its progression. Refer to NICE clinical guideline 101, "Management of COPD in adults in primary and secondary care (2010)," and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Guidelines for further information. Asthma There are a surprisingly small number of studies on smoking related asthma. Starting smoking as a teenager increases the risk of persisting asthma. One controlled cohort study suggested that exposure to passive smoke at home delayed recovery from an acute attack. Smoking reduces the benefits of inhaled steroids and this adds further justification for recording this outcome (Tomlinson et al., 2005). There is also epidemiological evidence that smoking is associated with poor asthma control (Price et al., 2005). CKD There is good evidence from observational studies that patients with CKD are at increased cardiovascular risk and hence the rationale for including CKD here. Schizophrenia, Bipolar Affective Disorder or Other Psychoses Patients with a serious mental illness are far more likely to smoke than the general population (61 per cent of patients with schizophrenia and 46 per cent of patients with bipolar disorder smoke compared to 33 per cent of the general population). Premature death and smoking related diseases, such as respiratory disorders and heart disease, are however, more common among patients with serious mental illness who smoke than in the general population of smokers (McDonald, 2000). Patients with any or any combination of the following conditions: coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), asthma, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder or other psychoses (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator whose notes record smoking status in the preceding 12 months (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a relatively common procedure. Our empirical analysis found a mean of 418 procedures per year. Higher volumes of PCI have been associated with better outcomes, namely fewer deaths and post-procedural coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (ACC/AHA/SCAI) have suggested that PCI be performed at hospitals performing at least 400 PCI procedures per year with an associated on-site cardiovascular surgical program by operators who perform at least 75 cases per year. This extends from the 1993 guidelines which indicated surgeons should perform the same number of cases per year, but institutions should perform at least 200 PCI specifically annually. Though many hospitals meet and exceed this rate, there are still hospitals that do not meet this guideline. PCI volume declined by 20 percent from 2006 to 2007 compared with a 56 percent increase in the previous decade.   The appropriateness and potential overuse of PCI has been discussed in the literature. PCI rates have been shown to vary widely and systematically between areas. Sociodemographic differences do not explain all of this variation, though inappropriate indications do not account fully for the variance either. Patient and physician preference may also play a role in the variation of PCI rates by area.  The ideal rate for PCI has not been established and indeed there are cases where PCI is an appropriate and necessary procedure. However, several studies have noted relatively high rates of inappropriate procedures (up to 48 percent). Other studies report very low rates of inappropriate use, leaving the question of the validity of this indicator open for interpretation. Methods of evaluating the appropriateness of procedures have been established in the literature cited in this report and by other sources. These methods could be used to evaluate the appropriateness of procedures within an area.   Area rates are based on the rates for hospitals within an area, and as such do not take into account that some patients are referred into area hospitals from a different area. Examination of data containing patient residence may aid in identifying the extent to which patients are referred into an area. HCUP data may also be used to examine which hospitals contribute the most to the overall area rate.  Note: As an area utilization indicator, PCI is a proxy for actual quality problems. The indicator has unclear construct validity, as high utilization of PCI has not been shown to necessarily be associated with higher rates of inappropriate utilization. A minor source of bias may be the small number of procedures performed on an outpatient basis. Caution should be maintained for PCI rates that are drastically below or above the average or recommended rates.   The following caveats affect the validity of this indicator:        Proxy: Indicator does not directly measure patient outcomes but an aspect of care that is associated with the outcome; thus, it is best used with other indicators that measure similar aspects of care.       Selection bias: This results when a substantial percentage of care for a condition is provided in the outpatient setting, so the subset of inpatient cases may be unrepresentative. Examination of outpatient care or emergency care data may help to reduce this in these cases.       Unclear construct: There is uncertainty or poor correlation with widely accepted process measures.       Unclear benchmark: The "correct rate" has not been established for the indicator; national, regional, or peer group averages may be the best benchmark available.    Discharges in the numerator are assigned to the denominator based on the Metro Area or county of the patient residence, not the Metro Area or county of the hospital where the discharge occurred (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Discharges, age 40 years and older, with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure code (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older suspected of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) who have leg duplex ultrasound (DUS) performed despite a low clinical pretest probability (CPTP) and a negative D-dimer test. The priority aim addressed by this measure is to improve accurate diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE).  It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year.  Patients with low clinical pretest probability (CPTP) of DVT, such as a score of zero on Wells scoring, can be safely managed by testing for D-dimer. If D-dimer is negative, duplex ultrasound can be omitted, and repeat ultrasound is not needed in one week unless new or progressive clinical symptoms occur.  Patients with a low CPTP of DVT and a negative D-dimer assay have a very low (less than 2%) risk of subsequent finding of DVT.

This measure* is used to assess the percent of patients 18 years of age and older with an ischemic stroke or a hemorrhagic stroke who received venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis or have documentation why no VTE prophylaxis was given the day of or the day after hospital admission.  *This is a Joint Commission only measure.Stroke patients are at increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). One study noted proximal deep vein thrombosis in more than a third of patients with moderately severe stroke.  Reported rates of occurrence vary depending on the type of screening used. Prevention of VTE, through the use of prophylactic therapies, in at risk patients is a noted recommendation in numerous clinical practice guidelines. For acutely ill stroke patients who are confined to bed, thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), or fondaparinux is recommended if there are no contraindications. Aspirin alone is not recommended as an agent to prevent VTE.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke who receive appropriate intervention for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of stroke patients age 18 years and over who receive appropriate medical management within the initial 24 to 48 hours of diagnosis for prevention of complications such as:        Dehydration       Aspiration       Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia       Deep vein thrombosis       Immobility       Falling       Nutritional status decline       Hyperthermia     Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  Detecting and treating hypoglycemia is a leading priority in managing patients presenting with stroke syndrome. Indeed, the stroke may be cured by giving glucose, since hypoglycemia is a famous stroke mimicker by producing asymmetric neurologic deficits. An evidence-based threshold for giving a bolus of glucose is not established.  Hyperglycemic control, although deemed important to treat, based on expert opinion, has not been adequately studied in the presence of the acute stroke phase.  Most observational studies document either increased mortality or decreased functional outcome, or both, with higher glucose levels. Some have speculated that early hyperglycemia in the setting of acute stroke is simply a marker of physiologic stress and an epiphenomenon in those who have suffered severe stroke. Others have documented that it is an independent predictor of poor outcome and propose that it has a causative role. Despite the extensive body of literature describing this relationship, a definitive clinical trial of managing hyperglycemia in ischemic stroke patients to improve outcome is still lacking. It remains unclear whether early hyperglycemia in the setting of acute stroke is a marker of physiologic stress or an independent predictor of poor outcome. Usual management of hyperglycemia (glucose levels greater than 180 mg/dL) with gentle dosing of subcutaneous insulin, avoiding hypoglycemia, in a timely manner during acute ischemia would seem prudent until ongoing clinical trials address the appropriateness of more aggressive treatment measures.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with cardiac arrest (CA) meeting the inclusion criterion who undergo therapeutic hypothermia.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.   The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.  Moderate hypothermia induced after cardiac arrest (CA) in patients who remain in coma after recovering circulation has proven to improve the neurological prognosis and reduce mortality. A lower level of evidence is recognized for its use after CA due to heart rhythms that do not respond to defibrillation.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of emergency department (ED) patients 18 years and older with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) closest to ED arrival time receiving fibrinolytic therapy during the ED stay and having a time from ED arrival to fibrinolysis of 30 minutes or less.  The measure rate for fibrinolytic agent received within 30 minutes of ED arrival should be analyzed in conjunction with the ED median time to fibrinolysis measure (OP-1). These measures, used together, will assist in understanding the number of AMI patients who are receiving fibrinolysis within 30 minutes of ED arrival and will identify the ED's median time to fibrinolysis and potential opportunities for improvement to increase the rate of patients receiving fibrinolysis in 30 minutes or less. See the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summary of the CMS OP-1 measure Acute myocardial infarction (AMI): median time from ED arrival to administration of fibrinolytic therapy in ED patients with AMI and ST-segment elevation or LBBB on the ECG performed closest to ED arrival and prior to transfer.Time to fibrinolytic therapy is a strong predictor of outcome in patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Nearly 2 lives per 1,000 patients are lost per hour of delay (Fibrinolytic Therapy Trialists' Collaborative Group, 1994). National guidelines recommend that fibrinolytic therapy be given within 30 minutes of hospital arrival in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (Antman et al., 2008).  Patients 18 years and older with an emergency department (ED) encounter who were discharged/transferred to a short-term general hospital for inpatient care, or to a Federal healthcare facility, with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed closest to ED arrival, and who received fibrinolytic therapy (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Emergency department (ED) acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients whose time from ED arrival to fibrinolysis is 30 minutes or less
This measure is used to assess the percentage of uncomplicated hypertensive patients age 18 through 60 with a blood pressure reading of greater than 140/90 mmHg who have a plan of care.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 and older with uncontrolled hypertension who have a plan of care.  Approximately 30% of the adult population in the United States has hypertension. The majority of people over 65 years of age carry this diagnosis. Therefore, approximately 66.9 million people in the United States carry the diagnosis of hypertension. It is estimated that this number will rise as the number of patients who are over the age of 65, as well as the number of patients who are obese, continue to increase.  Hypertension is the most common reason for adult office visits other than pregnancy and has the highest use of prescription drugs. Despite the number of resources used to treat this disease, only about 50% of hypertensives have their blood pressure under control using the definition of blood pressure less than 140/90.  Poor adherence to lifestyle changes and medication contribute to this poor outcome. Lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, weight loss, increased exercise and limiting alcohol abuse are difficult when there are no symptoms of the disease until secondary problems arise. It is also difficult to continue medications when drug-related side effects arise when the disease itself is asymptomatic. Inadequate access to medical care for chronic disease, as well as the cost of medication, contribute to poor control of blood pressure. Number of uncomplicated hypertension patients age 18 through 60 years and with blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients age 18 through 60 years and with uncomplicated hypertension and blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg who have a plan of care
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a fairly common procedure. Publication study results indicating unacceptable complication rates from CEA from 1984 to 1989 caused a decrease in the performance of CEA, but clinical trial results from 1989 through 1995 which showed benefit caused a surge in CEA procedures. Approximately 144,000 CEAs were performed in the U.S. in 1997 (5.3 per 10,000 persons). However, many hospitals perform relatively few procedures, suggesting that the actual annual count of procedures may not be a reliable guide to the number of procedures performed on an ongoing basis. Wenberg et. al. found that 0 percent of institutions in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) trials performed fewer than 17 procedures annually on Medicare beneficiaries. Approximately 50 percent of CEAs performed on Medicare beneficiaries in Ohio in 1 year were performed by operators who performed less than 21 procedures annually in hospitals that performed less than 62 procedures annually. Although these numbers involve Medicare patients only, Medicare beneficiaries comprise approximately 70 percent of the patients who undergo CEA, so total patient volumes are unlikely to differ substantially.  Our empirical analysis found a mean of 52 procedures per year. While a large number of hospitals perform at least 1 procedure, a range of hospitals (17 to 37 percent) are considered high volume, depending on the threshold for hospital volume used. The relationship between volume and outcome has been established in the literature, specifically which higher volume hospitals have lower mortality and post-operative stroke rates than lower volume hospitals; differences in patient case-mix do not account fully for these relationships. The relationship may be stronger for hospital volume than for operator volume. Nonetheless, providers may want to examine operator volume as well as hospital volume.   The volume-outcome relationship on which this indicator is based may not hold over time, as providers become more experienced or as technology changes. It is important then to revisit the volume-outcome relationship to ensure the validity of this indicator. Overall, volume measures are not direct measures of quality, and are relatively insensitive. For this reason they should be used with caution and in conjunction with other measure of mortality, to ensure that increasing volumes truly improve patient outcomes.  Our empirical analyses found that many CEA procedures are actually performed at high volume hospitals already. This leaves some room for improvement, but not as much as for other indicators. However, relatively few hospitals are high volume. It is unclear whether simply increasing volume at low volume hospitals would actually improve outcomes. It is possible that hospitals could increase volume simply by increasing the number of borderline or inappropriate procedures performed. For this reason, it may be prudent to examine this indicator alongside area rates for this procedure, and examinations of the appropriateness of the procedures.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of cardiac rehabilitation program(s) in the healthcare system that meet the specified performance measure criteria for communication with health care providers.  This performance measure is one of ten individual submeasures of the measure subset, Individualized Patient Assessment and Evaluation of Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Development of Individual Interventions, and Communication with Other Healthcare Providers.Optimal communication between the cardiac rehabilitation (CR) team and appropriate healthcare providers will promote timely adjustments in a patient's medical regimen, leading to improved risk factor modification.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients over age 60 years with isolated systolic hypertension on drug therapy with a blood pressure reading of less than 150 mmHg systolic.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of hypertensive patients age 18 and older whose blood pressure is in control.  Approximately 30% of the adult population in the United States has hypertension. The majority of people over 65 years of age carry this diagnosis. Therefore, approximately 66.9 million people in the United States carry the diagnosis of hypertension. It is estimated that this number will rise as the number of patients who are over the age of 65, as well as the number of patients who are obese, continue to increase.  Hypertension is the most common reason for adult office visits other than pregnancy and has the highest use of prescription drugs. Despite the number of resources used to treat this disease, only about 50% of hypertensives have their blood pressure under control using the definition of blood pressure less than 140/90.  Poor adherence to lifestyle changes and medication contribute to this poor outcome. Lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, weight loss, increased exercise and limiting alcohol abuse are difficult when there are no symptoms of the disease until secondary problems arise. It is also difficult to continue medications when drug-related side effects arise when the disease itself is asymptomatic. Inadequate access to medical care for chronic disease, as well as the cost of medication, contribute to poor control of blood pressure.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 18 to 75 years of age with diabetes (type 1 and type 2) who had an eye screening for diabetic retinal disease.  This measure is a component of the Comprehensive Diabetes Care composite measureone of 10 different rateslooking at how well an organization cares for the common and serious chronic disease of diabetes.  The denominator for all rates must be the same, with the exception of HbA1c control (less than 7.0%) for a selected population.  Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC):         For this measure, there are both Administrative and Hybrid Specifications. This NQMC measure summary is based on the Administrative Specification. Refer to the original measure documentation for details pertaining to the Hybrid Specification.

Diabetes is one of the most costly and highly prevalent chronic diseases in the United States. Approximately 20.8 million Americans have diabetes, and half these cases are undiagnosed. Complications from the disease cost the country nearly $100 billion annually. In addition, diabetes accounts for nearly 20 percent of all deaths in people over 25. Many complications, such as amputation, blindness, and kidney failure, can be prevented if detected and addressed in the early stages.

This measure is one component of a two-part survey measure that assesses different facets of managing aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. This measure uses survey data to assess the percentage of women 56 to 79 years of ageand men 46to 79 years who discussed the risks and benefits of using aspirin with a doctor or other health provider.   This measure is collected as part of the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Adult Version (commercial, Medicaid).  See the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summary of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) measure Aspirin use and discussion: percentage of members who are currently taking aspirin, including women 56 to 79 years of age with at least two risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD); men 46 to 65 years of age with at least one risk factor for CVD; and men 66 to 79 years of age, regardless of risk factors. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommends that clinicians discuss aspirin chemoprevention with adults who are at increased risk (five-year risk greater than or equal to 3 percent) for coronary heart disease (CHD). Discussions with patients should address both the potential benefits and harms of aspirin therapy. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) encourages the use of aspirin therapy (75-162 mg/day) as a primary prevention strategy in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who are at increased cardiovascular risk, including those who are 40 years of age and older or who have additional risk factors (e.g., family history of cardiovascular disease [CVD], hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, albuminuria).  In 2004, CHD was an underlying or contributing cause of death for 451,300 people and accounted for 1 of every 5 deaths in the United States (U.S.). The prevalence of CHD for both sexes in 2005 was nearly 16 million people, or 7.3 percent of the American population. The cost of cardiovascular diseases and stroke in the U.S. for 2008 was estimated at $448.5 billion, including health expenditures and lost productivity resulting from morbidity and mortality (indirect costs). Evidence shows that age is a strong demographic factor for CHD. It is projected that by 2030, 1 in 5 Americans will be 65 or older. The need for CHD management is essential.  Aspirin treatment has been shown to prevent one cardiovascular event over an average follow-up of 6.4 years. This means that, on average in a 6.4 year time period, the use of aspirin therapy results in a benefit of three cardiovascular events prevented per 1,000 women and four events prevented per 1,000 men. Aspirin has been shown to reduce CHD in patients with peripheral arterial disease, as well.  Aspirin therapy (75-162 mg/day) is also recommended as a secondary prevention strategy in patients who have diabetes and a history of CVD.  Specifications are consistent with current recommendations from USPSTF and ADA.

This measure is used to assess the percent of heart failure patients 18 years of age and older with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) who are prescribed an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) at hospital discharge. For purposes of this measure, LVSD is defined as chart documentation of a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% or a narrative description of left ventricular systolic (LVS) function consistent with moderate or severe systolic dysfunction.Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (SOLVD Investigators, 1991;CONSENSUS Trial Study Group, 1987) and are effective in a wide range of patients (Masoudi et al., 2004). Clinical trials have also established angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy as an acceptable alternative to ACEI, especially in patients who are ACEI intolerant (Granger et al., 2003; Pfeffer et al., 2003). National guidelines strongly recommend ACEIs for patients hospitalized with heart failure (Jessup et al., 2009;Lindenfeld et al., 2010). Guideline committees have also supported the inclusion of ARBs in performance measures for heart failure (Executive Council of the Heart Failure Society of America, 2004). Heart failure patients 18 years of age and older with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Heart failure patients who are prescribed an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) at hospital discharge
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with atrial fibrillation for whom there is a record of a CHADS2 score of 1 who are currently treated with anti-coagulation drug therapy or anti-platelet therapy. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common and significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The age-specific prevalence of AF is rising, presumably due to improved survival of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) (the commonest underlying cause of AF [Psaty et al., 1997]). One per cent of a typical practice population will be in AF; five per cent of patients aged 65 or over and nine percent of patients aged 75 or over. AF is associated with a five-fold increase in risk of stroke (Wolf, Abbott,  Kannel, 1991).  Refer to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) clinical guidelines "Cardiac arrhythmias in coronary heart disease" (SIGN Publication No. 94, 2007) and "Antithrombotics: indications and management" (SIGN Publication No. 129, 2013) for further information.  AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and, if left untreated, is a significant risk factor for stroke and other morbidities.  There is evidence that stroke risk can be substantially reduced by warfarin (approximately 66 per cent risk reduction) and less so by aspirin (approximately 22 per cent risk reduction) ("Risk factors for stroke," 1994).  To help clinicians decide which management path to choose, several tools have been developed to estimate the risk of stroke on the basis of clinical factors (National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions, 2006; Fang et al., 2008; Van Staa et al., 2011; Olesen et al., 2011). The scoring system recommended for Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) is CHADS2, which is validated and particularly suitable for identifying high-risk AF patients, while also being relatively simple to use (Gage et al., 2001). The CHADS2 system is based on the AF Investigators I Study (AFI1) and Stroke Prevention in AF I Study (SPAF1) risk criteria ("Risk factors for stroke," 1994; Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Investigators, 1992).  The revised CHADS2 system scores one point, up to a maximum of six, for each of the following risk factors (except previous stroke or transient ischemic attack [TIA], which scores double, hence the '2'):        C  Congestive heart failure (HF) (one point)       H  Hypertension (one point)       A  Age 75 or older (one point)       D  Diabetes mellitus (one point)       S2  Previous stroke or TIA (two points)     A score of zero is classified as low risk, one is moderate risk and two or more is high risk.  Evidence from the Birmingham AF Treatment of the Aged Study (BAFTA) (Mant et al., 2007) and AF Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events (ACTIVE-W) (Healey et al., 2008) studies suggests that not only is warfarin more effective than aspirin, but that it is not as unsafe (in terms of risk of serious haemorrhage) as previously thought. For example, in the BAFTA trial, the relative risk (RR) for stroke for patients treated with anti-coagulation versus aspirin was 0.46 (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 0.26 to 0.79). The same study showed no significant difference in the rate of haemorrhage between the warfarin and aspirin arms of the study (RR 0.88, 95 per cent CI 0.46 to 1.63), which suggested a shift in the balance between the risks and benefits of warfarin compared with aspirin. However, to date no meta-analysis has been identified combining the results of studies comparing the two treatments for the outcome of haemorrhage.  Anti-coagulation would not necessarily be indicated if the episode of AF was an isolated event that was not expected to re-occur (for example, one-off AF with a self-limiting cause).  This indicator uses the CHADS2 risk stratification scoring system to inform treatment options. The use of a risk stratification scoring system is in line with European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidance that states that 'recommendations for therapy should be based on the presence (or absence) of risk factors for stroke and thromboembolism'.  Where the CHADS2 score is 0 (low risk), then the patient can be offered treatment with aspirin (European Heart Rhythm Association et al., 2010). Where the CHADS2 score is 1 (moderate risk) then either aspirin or anti-coagulants can be offered. Patients with atrial fibrillation for whom there is a record of a CHADS2 score of 1 (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator who are currently treated with anti-coagulation drug therapy or anti-platelet therapy (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses who have a record of blood pressure in the preceding 12 months.The Mental Health indicator set reflects the complexity of mental health problems, and the complex mix of physical, psychological and social issues that present to general practitioners (GPs).  Indicators MH002, MH003, MH007 and MH008 relate to the care of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar or other affective disorders. Indicators MH009 and MH010 relate to the care of patients who are currently prescribed lithium. Indicator MH001 requires contractors to establish and maintain a register of individuals with a diagnosis of serious mental illness, e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar or other affective disorders and other patients on lithium therapy.  For many patients with mental health problems, the most important indicators relate to the interpersonal skills of the doctor, the time given in consultations and the opportunity to discuss a range of management options.  This indicator set focuses on patients with serious mental illness. There are separate indicator sets that focus on patients with depression and dementia.  Mental Health Indicators MH003, MH007 and MH008  It is recommended that patients receive health promotion and prevention advice appropriate to their age, gender and health status.  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline on schizophrenia (2009) recommends the components of a review and has separated them out to create a series of indicators. The NICE clinical guideline on bipolar disorder (2006) recommends that patients with bipolar affective disorder have a physical health review, normally in primary care, to ensure that the following are assessed:        Lipid levels, including cholesterol in all patients aged 40 or over even if there is no other indication of risk       Plasma glucose levels       Weight       Smoking status and alcohol use       Blood pressure     The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) continues to incentivise annual monitoring of blood pressure, alcohol and smoking status for patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses. Clinicians should use their professional judgement to decide when and how frequently checks of lipid levels, glucose levels and weight should be carried out, in accordance with the needs of each patient.  In addition to lifestyle factors, such as smoking, poor diet and lack of exercise, antipsychotic drugs vary in their liability for metabolic side effects such as weight gain, lipid abnormalities and disturbance of glucose regulation. Specifically, they increase the risk of the metabolic syndrome, a recognised cluster of features (hypertension, central obesity, glucose intolerance or insulin resistance or dyslipidaemia) which is a predictor of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) (Mackin et al., 2007).  Patients with schizophrenia have mortality between two and three times that of the general population and most of the excess deaths are from diseases that are the major causes of death in the general population. A recent prospective record linkage study of the mortality of a community cohort of 370 patients with schizophrenia found that the increased mortality risk is probably life-long, and it suggested that cardiovascular mortality of schizophrenia has increased over the past 25 years relative to the general population (Brown et al., 2010). The NICE clinical guideline on bipolar disorder also states that the standardised mortality ratio for cardiovascular death may be twice that of the general population but appears to be reduced if patients adhere to long-term medication.  Hypertension in people with schizophrenia is estimated at 19 per cent compared with 15 per cent in the general population (Hennekens et al., 2005). A cross-sectional study of 4310 patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2001 receiving care at veterans' administration facilities found a prevalence of hypertension of 35 per cent (Kilbourne et al., 2004).  There is evidence to suggest that physical conditions such as cardiovascular disorders go unrecognised in psychiatric patients. A direct comparison of cardiovascular screening (blood pressure, lipid levels and smoking status) of patients with asthma, patients with schizophrenia and other attendees indicated that general practice were less likely to screen patients with schizophrenia for cardiovascular risk compared with the other two groups (Roberts et al., 2007).  Recording (and treating) cardiovascular risk factors are therefore very important for patients with a serious mental illness.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) classified according to risk.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.  The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.   Risk stratification in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS): a) facilitates decision making and enables the correct analysis of mortality; b) is useful in the analysis and interpretation of results, making it possible to detect the underuse of certain treatments in high risk groups; c) facilitates clinical research.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients in the health care system's cardiac rehabilitation program(s) who meet the specified performance measure criteria for assessment of exercise capacity.  This performance measure is one of ten individual submeasures of the measure subset, Individualized Patient Assessment and Evaluation of Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Development of Individual Interventions, and Communication with Other Healthcare Providers.Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have concluded that comprehensive, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) reduces mortality rates in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD).

This measure is used to determine the percentage of surgical procedures in which pneumatic tourniquet cuff pressure and time of inflation are recorded.Ischemic neuromuscular injury may occur if the pneumatic tourniquet remains inflated too long. Direct pressure injury to nerves may also occur. Additionally, tourniquet inflation and deflation may depress the cardiorespiratory function in the perioperative period, including causing "showers" of embolic debris to the heart, which may in turn cause pulmonary embolism.    Main aim of indicator: to increase the percentage of surgical procedures in which pneumatic tourniquet pressure and time of inflation are controlled.   Number of patients undergoing surgical procedures with pneumatic tourniquet-induced ischemia Number of procedures in which pneumatic tourniquet time and pressure are recorded x 100
This measure* estimates a hospital-level, risk-standardized, all-cause unplanned 30-day readmission rate (RSRR) for patients discharged from the hospital with a principal discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).  *This is a Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) only measure.The Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) developed the acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 30-day readmission measure to complement the existing AMI process of care and mortality measures. Risk-standardized readmission rates (RSRRs) can provide important additional information about quality of care that is currently not captured by the process and mortality measures and is currently unavailable to hospitals. Variation in readmission, after adjusting for case-mix, may reflect differences in hospitals' general environments (such as coordination of care, patient safety policies, and staffing) or variation in care processes not measured in the current core measure set. Outcome measures can focus attention on a broader set of healthcare activities that affect patients' well-being. Moreover, improving outcomes is the ultimate goal of quality improvement, and thus the inclusion of outcomes measures assists in attaining improvement goals.  Readmission of patients who were recently discharged after hospitalization with AMI represents an important, expensive, and often preventable adverse outcome. The risk of readmission can be modified by the quality and type of care provided to these patients. Improving readmission rates is the joint responsibility of hospitals and clinicians. Measuring readmission will create incentives to invest in interventions to improve hospital care, better assess the readiness of patients for discharge, and facilitate transitions to outpatient status. This measure is also responsive to the call by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to develop readmission measures, with AMI highlighted as one of seven conditions that account for nearly 30% of potentially preventable readmissions in the 15-day window after initial hospital discharge (MedPAC, 2007). The measure cohort consists of admissions for Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) and Veterans Health Administration (VA) beneficiaries aged 65 years and older discharged from non-federal acute care hospitals or VA hospitals with a principal discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).  The risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" readmissions to the number of "expected" readmissions, multiplied by the national unadjusted readmission rate. The "denominator" is the number of readmissions expected on the basis of the nation's performance with that hospital's case-mix.  See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.  Note: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the measure cohort.  See the 2013 Measures Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-Standardized Readmission Measures for Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and Pneumonia for more details. The measure assesses unplanned readmissions to any acute care hospital within a 30-day period from the date of discharge from the index acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admission.  The hospital-specific risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" readmissions to the number of "expected" readmissions, multiplied by the national unadjusted readmission rate. The "numerator" of the ratio is the number of readmissions within 30 days predicted on the basis of the hospital's performance with its observed case-mix.  See the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.  Note: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the outcome.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke OR intracranial hemorrhage who received deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis by end of hospital day 2.    To promote a comprehensive approach to performance improvement, the Stroke and Stroke Rehabilitation Measurement Set is intended for use in its entirety when measuring clinical quality in the care of eligible patients. Full implementation of this measurement set for patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) should always include the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement measure, Radiology: Stenosis Measurement in Carotid Imaging Reports.Patients on bed rest are at high risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT prevention is important for all patients who have suffered a stroke or an intracranial hemorrhage and may have decreased mobility. The intent of this measure is to assure that adequate DVT prophylaxis is received for either diagnosis. As noted in the clinical recommendation statements*, the appropriate type of prophylaxis differs by diagnosis. Anticoagulants are generally contraindicated in patients with intracranial hemorrhage. These patients are still at risk for DVT so they should receive prophylaxis with mechanical devices. Low-dose subcutaneous heparin may be initiated on the second day after onset of the hemorrhage.  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, low-molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), and heparinoids may be considered for DVT prophylaxis in at-risk patients with acute ischemic stroke, recognizing that nonpharmacologic treatments for DVT prevention also exist. (American Academy of Neurology/American Stroke Association [AAN/ASA])  The use of intermittent external compression stockings or aspirin for patients who cannot receive anticoagulants is strongly recommended to prevent deep vein thrombosis among immobilized patients. (ASA)  For acute stroke patients with restricted mobility, we recommend prophylactic low-dose subcutaneous heparin or low-molecular-weight heparins or heparinoids. In patients with an acute intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), we recommend the initial use of intermittent pneumatic compression for the prevention of DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE). In stable patients, we suggest low-dose subcutaneous heparin may be initiated as soon as the second day after the onset of the hemorrhage. (American College of Chest Physicians [ACCP]) All patients aged 18 years and older with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke OR intracranial hemorrhage (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who received deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis by end of hospital day 2 (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percent of surgery patients 18 years of age and older on beta-blocker therapy prior to arrival who received a beta-blocker during the perioperative period. The perioperative period for the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) Cardiac measure is defined as the day prior to surgery through postoperative day two (POD 2) with day of surgery being day zero.  If the postoperative length of stay is greater than or equal to 2 days, the measure evaluates the administration of more than one dose of a beta-blocker: the day prior to or the day of surgery and on postoperative day one (POD 1) or postoperative day two (POD 2) unless reasons for not administering the medication were documented. If the postoperative length of stay is less than 2 days, the measure will evaluate the administration of the beta-blocker on the day prior to or the day of surgery only, unless reasons for not administering the medication were documented.Concerns regarding the discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy in the perioperative period have existed for several decades. Shammash and colleagues studied a total of 140 patients who received beta-blockers preoperatively. Mortality in the 8 patients who had beta-blockers discontinued postoperatively (50%) was significantly greater than in the 132 patients in whom beta-blockers were continued. Hoeks and colleagues studied 711 consecutive peripheral vascular surgery patients. After adjustment for potential confounders and the propensity of its use, continuous beta-blocker use remained significantly associated with a lower 1-year mortality than among nonusers. In contrast, beta-blocker withdrawal was associated with an increased risk of 1-year mortality compared with nonusers. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cite continuation of beta-blocker therapy in the perioperative period as a class I indication, and accumulating evidence suggests that titration to maintain tight heart rate control should be the goal.

This measure is used to assess percentage of patients age 18 years and older with stable coronary artery disease who have demonstrated an understanding of how to respond in an acute cardiac event by "teaching back" as to how they would respond in the case of acute cardiac event, including the following:        Proper use of nitroglycerin       Consistent use of aspirin (unless contraindicated), or consistent use of clopidogrel as directed       When to call 911   The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease who understand the self-management of their condition.  An important aspect to treatment of stable coronary artery disease is education to help the patient understand the disease processes, prognosis, treatment options and signs of worsening cardiac ischemia so that prompt medical assistance is sought when necessary and appropriate. Education may be accomplished in a number of ways among the various medical groups. It may be ongoing, occur in a formal class and/or be done at the clinician visit. Instruction on the proper use of aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin, as needed, should also be reviewed at this time.  Education should also provide for patient to "teach back" in order to demonstrate their understanding of what they should do in an acute cardiac event. Number of stable coronary artery disease patients (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of stable coronary artery disease patients who have demonstrated an understanding of how to respond in an acute cardiac event by "teaching back" as to how they would respond in the case of acute cardiac event, including the following:         Proper use of nitroglycerin       Consistent use of aspirin (unless contraindicated), or consistent use of clopidogrel as directed       When to call 911   
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients 18 years and older with cardiovascular disease with documentation of screening for major depression or persistent depressive disorder using Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2).The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the assessment for major depression or persistent depressive disorder of primary care patients presenting with any additional high-risk conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, post-stroke, chronic pain and all perinatal women.  At any given time, 9% of the population has a depressive disorder, and 3.4% has major depression (Strine et al., 2008). In a 12-month time period, 6.6% of the U.S. population will have experienced major depression, and 16.6% of the population will experience depression in their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005).  Major depression is a treatable cause of pain, suffering, disability and death, yet primary care clinicians detect major depression in only one-third to one-half of their patients with major depression (Williams et al., 2002; Schonfeld et al., 1997). Additionally, more than 80% of patients with depression have a medical comorbidity (Klinkman, 2003). Usual care for depression in the primary care setting has resulted in only about half of depressed adults getting treated (Kessler et al., 2005) and only 20% to 40% showing substantial improvement over 12 months (Untzer et al., 2002; Katon et al., 1999). Approximately 70% to 80% of antidepressants are prescribed in primary care, making it critical that clinicians know how to use them and have a system that supports best practices (Mojtabai  Olfson, 2008).  The importance of the interplay between depression and many medical comorbidities cannot be overstated. A long list of medical conditions has been associated with increased risk for depression; these include chronic pain, diabetes, cancer, HIV, Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis, to name a few (Kozhimannil, Pereira,  Harlow, 2009; Egede, 2005; Katon et al., 2004).  Some studies have shown that major depression is associated with an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease (Wulsin  Singal, 2003; Rugulies, 2002), and with an increased risk of mortality in patients after myocardial infarction by as much as fourfold (Lichtman et al., 2008; Frasure-Smith, Lesprance,  Talajic, 1995), while other analyses have disputed this (Jiang  Davidson, 2005; Nicholson, Kuper,  Hemingway, 2006).  Moderate to severe depression before coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and/or persistent depression after surgery increases the risk of death after CABG more than twofold higher than non-depressed patients (Blumenthal, Lett,  Babyak, 2003).  Depression is three times more common in patients after acute myocardial infarction than in the general population and, notably, young women are at particularly high risk for depression after myocardial infarction (Lichtman et al., 2008).  Either the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) or the PHQ-9 can be used to screen for depression. There is stronger evidence supporting the use of the PHQ-9 in patients with chronic disease. The PHQ two-question tool (PHQ-2) should be used in routine screening settings (Gilbody et al., 2006). If the patient answers "yes" to either of the two questions, the full PHQ-9 depression instrument should be administered (Kroenke et al., 2010). Number of patients age 18 years and older with cardiovascular disease who had at least one contact with a clinician in primary care in the last 12 months from the measurement date (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)  Number of patients screened for depression symptoms (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure* estimates a hospital-level risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) for patients discharged from the hospital with a principal diagnosis of heart failure (HF).  *This is a Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) only measure.Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of hospitalization among Medicare beneficiaries and is associated with considerable risk of morbidity and mortality. Although HF is a progressive illness for which death may be an inevitable consequence rather than a marker of poor quality, clinical experience suggests that the care for these patients is highly variable and studies suggest gaps in quality of hospital care, particularly in the transition to outpatient care. Moreover, there is substantial inter-hospital variation in the risk of death at 30 days that is not explained by differences in case-mix. Many stakeholders, including patient organizations, are interested in outcomes measures for this common condition that could be used to assess the relative performance of a hospital and provide the opportunity for comparison with other institutions. The measure cohort consists of admissions for Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) and Veterans Health Administration (VA) beneficiaries aged 65 years and older discharged from non-federal acute care hospitals or VA hospitals, having a principal discharge diagnosis of heart failure (HF).  The hospital-specific risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" deaths to the number of "expected" deaths, multiplied by the national unadjusted mortality rate. The "denominator" is the number of deaths expected on the basis of the nation's performance with that hospital's case-mix.  See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.  Note: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the measure cohort.  See the 2013 Measures Updates and Specifications: Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and Pneumonia 30-Day Risk-Standardized Mortality Measures for more details. The measure counts death from any cause within 30 days after the index admission date.  The hospital-specific risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" deaths to the number of "expected" deaths, multiplied by the national unadjusted mortality rate. The "numerator" of the ratio is the number of deaths within 30 days predicted on the basis of the hospital's performance with its observed case-mix.  Note: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the outcome.  See the 2013 Measures Updates and Specifications: Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and Pneumonia 30-Day Risk-Standardized Mortality Measures for more details.
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Craniotomy for the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and/or cerebral aneurysm is a condition and treatment that entails significant risk, with post-operative patient mortality and complications as the result of stroke, intracranial hypertension, systemic infections, hypoxia, pulmonary embolus, and cardiac arrythmias. The procedure requires significant technical skill, and the ability to identify the most appropriate cases. Providers with high rates have better outcomes, though this may be an artifact of patient selection. We found little further evidence on the face validity or construct validity of this indicator.  As with other mortality measures, there is concern that measuring mortality rates would result in access problems for higher risk patients. If possible, it may be useful to monitor the outcomes for subarachnoid hemorrhage or cerebral aneurysm patients that do not undergo surgery.  Providers that perform more than 30 procedures per year have lower mortality than providers performing fewer than 30. Patients from 1996 to 1997 identified through the National Inpatient Sample with craniotomy or craniectomy procedures had significantly reduced risk of mortality at very high-volume hospitals (odds ratio [OR] 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.97, p=0.038) and very high volume surgeons (OR 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22-0.84, p=0.012) where the volume was determined by quartile from very low to very high.   Note: The following caveats were identified from the literature review for the Craniotomy Mortality Rate indicator:        Confounding bias: Patient characteristics may substantially affect the performance of the indicator; risk adjustment is recommended. This concern has been demonstrated in the literature.       Unclear construct: There is uncertainty or poor correlation with widely accepted process measures. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.

This measure is used to assess the age-standardized rate of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) performed on patients in acute care hospitals, same-day surgery facilities or catheterization laboratories per 100,000 population age 20 years and over.Cardiac revascularization procedures are used to restore or improve blood supply to the heart muscle, which reduces the symptoms of coronary heart disease, such as chest pain and weakness. Revascularization can improve the quality of patients' lives and reduce mortality.  In many cases, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) serves as a non-surgical alternative to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and is undertaken for the purpose of opening obstructed coronary arteries. While PCI encompasses several techniques, angioplasty is the procedure most frequently provided. The choice of revascularization mode (i.e., PCI or CABG) depends on numerous factors including physician preferences, availability of services, referral patterns, as well as differences in population health.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke who receive appropriate intervention for hyperthermia.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of stroke patients age 18 years and over who receive appropriate medical management within the initial 24 to 48 hours of diagnosis for prevention of complications such as:        Dehydration       Aspiration       Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia       Deep vein thrombosis       Immobility       Falling       Nutritional status decline       Hyperthermia     Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  The acutely injured brain, whether due to trauma or ischemia, is inordinately susceptible to the damaging effects of brain temperature elevation. This fact is well supported by both animal and human studies.   In human studies, early hyperthermia in acute stroke is associated with increased risk of poor outcome, higher mortality, and increased infarct volume. The causality and the relationship of temperature elevation to these poor outcomes are not fully understood. Whether intervention with cooling methods will result in improved outcomes is unknown. Number of patients presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients who have appropriate intervention for hyperthermia
This measure is used to assess the percentage of final reports for computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain performed either:        In the hospital within 24 hours of arrival, OR       In an outpatient imaging center to confirm initial diagnosis of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or intracranial hemmorhage.     For patients aged 18 years and older with either a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or TIA or intracranial hemorrhage OR at least one documented symptom consistent with ischemic stroke or TIA or intracranial hemorrhage that includes documentation of the presence or absence of each of the following: hemorrhage and mass lesion and acute infarction.  To promote a comprehensive approach to performance improvement, the Stroke and Stroke Rehabilitation Measurement Set is intended for use in its entirety when measuring clinical quality in the care of eligible patients. Full implementation of this measurement set for patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) should always include the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement measure, Radiology: Stenosis Measurement in Carotid Imaging Reports.The computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are critical to initiating care for the patient with stroke. All CT and MRI reports should address the presence or absence of these three important findings. This documentation is particularly vital in the report of the first imaging study performed after arrival at the hospital, on which initial treatment decisions will be based.*  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  Brain imaging is required to guide acute intervention. (Grade A) There is a uniform agreement that CT accurately identifies most cases of intracranial hemorrhage and helps discriminate nonvascular causes of neurological symptoms (e.g., brain tumor). With the advent of rtPA treatment, interest has grown in using CT to identify subtle, early signs of ischemic brain injury (early infarct signs) or arterial occlusion that might affect decisions about treatment. The presence of these signs is associated with poor outcomes. (American Stroke Association [ASA])  A technically adequate head CT scan is required prior to administration of thrombolytic therapy to exclude brain hemorrhage and nonischemic diagnoses. The baseline CT scan is also sensitive for detection of early signs of cerebral infarction. Subtle or limited signs of early infarction on the CT scan are common even within the first 3 h of stroke evolution.  Preliminary data suggest that specific MRI profiles may identify patients who are particularly likely to benefit from thrombolytic therapy. New MRI techniques including perfusion-weighted and diffusion-weighted may detect ischemic injury in the first hour and may reveal the extent of reversible and irreversible injury. In addition, MRI appears to be highly sensitive for identification of acute brain hemorrhage. (American College of Chest Physicians [ACCP]) All final reports for computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain performed either:        In the hospital within 24 hours of arrival OR       In an outpatient imaging center to confirm initial diagnosis of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or intracranial hemorrhage     See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field. Final reports of the initial computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that include documentation of the presence or absence of each of the following: hemorrhage and mass lesion and acute infarction
This measure is used to assess the percentage of uncomplicated hypertensive adult patients age 18 to 60 years with a blood pressure reading of less than 140/90 mmHg.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of hypertensive patients age 18 and older whose blood pressure is in control.  Approximately 30% of the adult population in the United States has hypertension. The majority of people over 65 years of age carry this diagnosis. Therefore, approximately 66.9 million people in the United States carry the diagnosis of hypertension. It is estimated that this number will rise as the number of patients who are over the age of 65, as well as the number of patients who are obese, continue to increase.  Hypertension is the most common reason for adult office visits other than pregnancy and has the highest use of prescription drugs. Despite the number of resources used to treat this disease, only about 50% of hypertensives have their blood pressure under control using the definition of blood pressure less than 140/90.  Poor adherence to lifestyle changes and medication contribute to this poor outcome. Lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, weight loss, increased exercise and limiting alcohol abuse are difficult when there are no symptoms of the disease until secondary problems arise. It is also difficult to continue medications when drug-related side effects arise when the disease itself is asymptomatic. Inadequate access to medical care for chronic disease, as well as the cost of medication, contribute to poor control of blood pressure. Number of adult patients age 18 to 60 years with uncomplicated hypertension (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of adult patients age 18 to 60 years with uncomplicated hypertension who had a blood pressure reading of less than 140/90 mmHg (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure for whom the quantitative or qualitative results of a recent or prior (any time in the past) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment is documented within a 12 month period.Heart failure is a chronic condition that poses a major and growing threat to the public's health. Improving the effectiveness of care and optimizing patient outcomes will become increasingly important as the population of the United States ages.  Evaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with heart failure provides important information that is required to appropriately direct treatment. Several pharmacologic therapies have demonstrated efficacy in slowing disease progression and improving outcomes in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. LVEF assessed during the initial evaluation of patients presenting with heart failure can be considered valid unless the patient has demonstrated a major change in clinical status, experienced or recovered from a clinical event, or received therapy that might have a significant effect on cardiac function.   A comprehensive 2-dimensional echocardiogram with Doppler flow studies has been identified as the single most useful diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients with heart failure.  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  Two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler should be performed during initial evaluation of patients presenting with [heart failure] to assess LVEF, [left ventricular] size, wall thickness, and valve function. Radionuclide ventriculography can be performed to assess LVEF and volumes.  Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography may be useful in evaluating chamber size and ventricular mass, detecting right ventricular dysplasia, or recognizing the presence of pericardial disease, as well as in assessing cardiac function and wall motion. All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients for whom the quantitative or qualitative results of a recent or prior (any time in the past) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment is documented within a 12 month period (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) 
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patient visits for those patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure with quantitative results of an evaluation of both current level of activity and clinical symptoms documented.Heart failure is a chronic condition that poses a major and growing threat to the public's health. Improving the effectiveness of care and optimizing patient outcomes will become increasingly important as the population of the United States ages.  Initial and ongoing evaluations of patients with heart failure should include an assessment of symptoms and their functional consequences. These assessments serve as the basis for making treatment decisions, monitoring the effects of treatment, and modifying treatment as appropriate. The results of this assessment have also been shown to have prognostic significance. Decreasing symptoms and improving function are two of the primary goals of heart failure treatment and represent important patient-centric outcomes for heart failure care.  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  In patients presenting with [heart failure], initial assessment should be made of a patient's ability to perform routine and desired activities of daily living.  Assessment should be made at each visit of the ability of a patient with [heart failure] to perform routine and desired activities of daily living.  During the initial and subsequent visits, healthcare providers should inquire about the type, severity, and duration of symptoms that occur during activities of daily living and that may impair the patient's functional capacity. A variety of approaches have been used to quantify the degree of functional limitation imposed by [heart failure]. The most widely used scale is the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, but this system is subject to considerable interobserver variability and is insensitive to important changes in exercise capacity. These limitations may be overcome by formal tests of exercise tolerance.  The evaluation of patients with an established diagnosis of [heart failure] is undertaken to identify the etiology, assess symptom nature and severity, determine functional impairment, and establish a prognosis. Follow-up of patients with [heart failure] or cardiac dysfunction involves continuing reassessment of symptoms, functional capacity, prognosis, and therapeutic effectiveness.  It is recommended that the severity of clinical disease and functional limitation be evaluated and recorded and the ability to perform typical daily activities be determined. This evaluation may be graded by metrics such as NYHA functional class or by the 6-minute walk test. All patient visits for those patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patient visits with quantitative results of an evaluation of both current level of activity and clinical symptoms documented (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of ischemic stroke patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke who are assessed with a swallow screening test before receiving food, fluids or medications by mouth.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of stroke patients age 18 years and over who receive appropriate medical management within the initial 24 to 48 hours of diagnosis for prevention of complications such as:        Dehydration       Aspiration       Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia       Deep vein thrombosis       Immobility       Falling       Nutritional status decline       Hyperthermia     Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  Pneumonia is a common finding among patients with acute stroke, its incidence ranging from 6% to 32%, and it is associated with stroke-related dysphagia symptoms. Implementation of a coordinated swallow evaluation on all acute stroke patients has been shown to significantly decrease the incidence of pneumonia among patients with acute stroke. Adherence with use of a dysphagia screening tool for patients with acute stroke has been shown to be variable with up to 25% of patients not screened. When implemented, failing a dysphagia screen has been found to be a predictor of post-stroke pneumonia. Lack of standardized, high-quality tools has hampered implementation, and a review found only four of 35 protocols met basic quality criteria. Those four protocols included the Barnes Jewish Hospital Stroke Dysphagia Screen, the modified Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability, the Emergency Physician Swallowing Screen and Toronto Bedside Swallowing Screen Test. Lack of consensus around the best tools to use has also led the Joint Commission to retire the dysphagia screen measure as a performance indicator for certification as a Primary Stroke Center. Number of all patients presenting with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients who were screened for dysphagia before taking any food, fluids or medication (including aspirin) by mouth
This measure is used to assess the percentage of male patients age 34 years and older who have lipid screening every five years. The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the rate of patients up-to-date with Level I preventive services.  Level I preventive services are worthy of attention at every opportunity. Busy clinicians cannot deliver this many services in any single encounter. However, with systems in place to track whether or not patients are up-to-date with the high-priority preventive services for their age group, clinicians can recommend the high-priority services as opportunities present.  Lipid testing is recommended because elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL), elevated triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) are important risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). Treatment of these risk factors is readily available and significantly decreases the risk for CHD. Number of male patients age 34 years and older Number of male patients age 34 years and older who had lipid screening every five years
This measure is used to assess whether the hospital's heart surgery unit has a registry that includes the following indicators:        Number of re-examinations       Prolonged mechanical ventilation       Surgical wound infection       Perioperative cerebrovascular accident (CVA)       Perioperative acute myocardial infarction (AMI)       Postoperative renal failure       Risk-adjusted hospital mortality   The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.   The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.  Units with heart surgery are recommended to have a specific registry about some related indicators related to process and outcome to enable the quality of care to be assessed. Likewise, the registry enables benchmarking with other units. This measure applies to hospitals (one hospital at a time) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field). The hospital's heart surgery unit has a registry that includes most of the specified indicators (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field).
This measure assesses the percent of patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) among patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) with blood pressure greater than 130/80 mmHg with or without antihypertensive treatment.Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) are situated at a crossroads between patients with less severe chronic kidney disease, where strict blood pressure control is a well established mainstay of therapy, and patients on dialysis, where blood pressure goals are not well understood. In the absence of strong scientific data to define therapeutic targets, blood pressure goals in dialysis patients remain extrapolated from the general population. Because of significantly increased cardiovascular risk in patients with both advanced CKD and diabetes, management of patients with both conditions deserves special attention.  Numerous randomized, controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce the progression of CKD. These studies have examined type I and type II diabetic as well as non-diabetic nephropathies, utilizing endpoints such as serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), time to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and death. Most investigations report that patients receiving an ACE inhibitor have a reduction in disease progression that is greater than for patients with similar levels of blood pressure control without ACE inhibition. The additional benefit conferred by ACE inhibitors is thought to be related, in part, to reduction in proteinuria levels. ACE inhibition has also been shown to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease and patients with diabetes mellitus and at least one other coronary artery disease risk factor. The mortality benefit conferred by ACE inhibitors may be greater for patients with elevated serum creatinine compared to those with normal renal function.  Patients with CKD often have coronary artery disease, diabetes, or other important cardiovascular risk factors. They are considered to be in the highest category for cardiac risk and are thus likely to derive benefit from ACE inhibition. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have also been shown to reduce progression of chronic kidney disease in subjects with type II diabetes mellitus. In one study, patients taking an ARB also had fewer hospitalizations for heart failure. There are no clinical outcomes data currently regarding ARB use and non-diabetic nephropathy. Similarly, no large trials in patients at risk for coronary artery disease have been undertaken. The number of adult patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), not currently receiving renal replacement therapy, with blood pressure greater than 130/80 mmHg with or without antihypertensive treatment The number of patients from the denominator on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)
This measure is used to determine whether or not the hospital has a protocol for nursing practices for controlled ischemia in surgical procedures and postoperative care.Ischemic neuromuscular injury may occur if the pneumatic tourniquet remains inflated too long. Direct pressure injury to nerves may also occur. Additionally, tourniquet inflation and deflation may depress the cardiorespiratory function in the perioperative period, including causing "showers" of embolic debris to the heart, which may in turn cause pulmonary embolism.    The existence of a protocol for nursing practices for controlled ischemia in surgical procedures reflects the hospital's endeavors to prevent these adverse events.   This measure applies to hospitals (one hospital at a time). The hospital has a protocol for nursing practices for controlled ischemia in surgical procedures and postoperative care.
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with venous thromboembolism (VTE) who are initially prescribed warfarin therapy with documentation in the medical record indicating a baseline international normalized ratio (INR) was obtained.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to safely use anticoagulants to reduce the likelihood of patient harm and complications of anticoagulation therapy.  It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year. Number of patients age 18 years and older and diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and initially prescribed warfarin Number of patients age 18 years and older and diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) who are initially prescribed warfarin therapy with documentation in the medical record indicating a baseline international normalized ratio (INR) was obtained
This measure is used to assess the proportion of stroke patients in each risk-adjusted group, ages 16 years and older, that make at least one level of progress on the Voice Functional Communication Measure (FCM).    The Voice FCM is one of 15 FCM scales which are used to measure outcomes of speech and language therapy in the realm of swallowing and 14 areas of communication over time.  Each scale is composed of seven-point ratings ranging from least functional (level 1) to most functional (level 7).Changes in Functional Communication Measure (FCM) level provide information on the benefits of treatment designed to enhance functional communication and swallowing.  FCMs were designed to describe aspects of a patient's functional communication and swallowing abilities over time from admission to discharge in various speech-language pathology treatment settings. Stroke patients, ages 16 years and older, with a treatment plan recommending speech and language intervention for a minimum of two sessions. Patients must receive speech and language intervention using either an individual and/or group treatment model or a training and/or consultation model.  See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field. The number of stroke patients in each risk-adjusted group that make at least one level of progress on the Voice Functional Communication Measure (FCM)    Note: Refer to the original measure documentation for additional details.
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.The estimated acute myocardial infarction (AMI) incidence in 2011 was 610,000 new attacks and 325,000 recurrent attacks. Reductions in the mortality rate for AMI on both the patient-level and the provider-level has been related to better processes of care. Timely and effective treatments are essential for patient outcome, and include appropriate use of thrombolytic therapy and when appropriate, revascularization. The evidence surrounding the validity of AMI mortality as a quality indicator is substantial.   AMI mortality rate is measured with adequate precision, with high systematic variation, and a moderate signal ratio. This suggests that some of the observed variance may not actually reflect true differences in performance. Multivariate techniques help in extracting additional signal and are recommended. Using smoothed estimates (e.g. multivariate signal extraction) may help to avoid precision problems due to random noise.   Hospital discharge practices differ, with some hospitals discharging patients earlier than others. For this reason, this indicator should be considered in conjunction with length of stay and transfer rates (though transfers are excluded in this indicator).  Note: The following caveats affect the validity of the indicator:        Information bias: This indicator is based on information available in hospital discharge data sets, but some missing information may actually be important to evaluating the outcomes of hospital care. Examination of missing information may help to improve indicator performance in these cases. The concern has been demonstrated in the literature.       Confounding bias: Patient characteristics may substantially affect the performance of the indicator; risk adjustment is recommended. The concern has been demonstrated in the literature.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients in the healthcare system's cardiac rehabilitation program(s) who meet the specified performance measure criteria for blood pressure control.  This performance measure is one of ten individual submeasures of the measure subset, Individualized Patient Assessment and Evaluation of Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Development of Individual Interventions, and Communication with Other Healthcare Providers.The blood pressure (BP) levels represent a strong, consistent, continuous, independent, and etiologically relevant risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease. Optimal control of BP has a beneficial impact on lowering cardiovascular risk.

This measure is used to assess the median time from hospital arrival to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed closest to hospital arrival time. This measure rate should be analyzed in conjunction with the measure rate for the related measure, Acute myocardial infarction (AMI): percent of patients with ST-segment elevation or LBBB on the ECG closest to arrival time receiving primary PCI during the hospital stay with a time from hospital arrival to PCI of 90 minutes or less. These measures, used together, will assist in understanding the median time to primary PCI, and will identify the number of AMI patients that are receiving primary PCI within 90 minutes of hospital arrival and potential opportunities for improvement to decrease the median time to primary PCI.The early use of primary angioplasty in patients with ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI) results in a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity. The earlier primary coronary intervention is provided, the more effective it is (Brodie et al., 1998; DeLuca et al., 2004). National guidelines recommend the prompt initiation of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (American College of Emergency Physicianset al., 2013; Kushner et al., 2009). Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed closest to hospital arrival who received primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 24 hours after hospital arrival (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Continuous variable statement: Time (in minutes) from hospital arrival to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed closest to hospital arrival
This measure is used to assess the percentage of hospitalized patients 18 years and older hospitalized for a medical condition or surgery at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) who have VTE education within 24 hours of admission that includes 1) VTE risk, 2) signs and symptoms, 3) early and frequent mobilization, and 4) clinically appropriate treatment/prophylaxis methods.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of hospitalized patients 18 years of age and older at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) who have received education within 24 hours of admission into the inpatient care setting for VTE that includes VTE risk, signs and symptoms, early and frequent mobilization and clinically appropriate treatment/prophylaxis methods. Number of adult patients who are hospitalized for a medical condition or surgery at risk for venous thromboembolism (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of adult patients hospitalized for a medical condition or surgery at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) who have VTE education within 24 hours of admission that includes 1) VTE risk, 2) signs and symptoms, 3) early and frequent mobilization, and 4) clinically appropriate treatment/prophylaxis methods
This measure is used to assess whether the contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with established hypertension.Hypertension is a common medical condition which is largely managed in primary care and represents a significant workload for general practitioners (GPs) and the primary care team. Trials of anti-hypertensive treatment have confirmed a significant reduction in the incidence of stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with treated hypertension.  A number of patients may be wrongly coded in this group, for example patients who have had one-off high blood pressure readings or women who have been hypertensive in pregnancy.  Elevated blood pressure readings of greater than 140/90 mmHg on three separate occasions have generally been used to confirm sustained high blood pressure. However, the 2011 updated National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline on hypertension now recommends the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension, particularly if a clinic blood pressure reading is 140/90 mmHg or higher.   The use of ABPM to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension is a change in practice and may take time to be integrated into routine clinical practice.   For patients aged 39 or under with stage 1 hypertension and no evidence of target organ damage, cardiovascular disease (CVD), renal disease or diabetes, NICE recommend that practitioners consider seeking specialist evaluation of secondary causes of hypertension and a more detailed assessment of potential target organ damage. This is because 10-year cardiovascular risk assessments can underestimate the lifetime risk of cardiovascular events in these patients.  Refer to NICE guidance "Prevention of cardiovascular disease" (2010) for further information.  Establishing and maintaining disease registers is good professional practice and ensures a defined population is identified for undertaking further evidence-based interventions. Disease registers also make it possible to call and recall patients effectively to provide systematic care and to undertake care audits. This measure applies to contractors whose patient population includes individuals with established hypertension (one contractor at a time). The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with established hypertension.
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients over age 60 years with isolated systolic hypertension on drug therapy with a blood pressure reading greater than 150 mmHg systolic who have a plan of care.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 and older with uncontrolled hypertension who have a plan of care.  Approximately 30% of the adult population in the United States has hypertension. The majority of people over 65 years of age carry this diagnosis. Therefore, approximately 66.9 million people in the United States carry the diagnosis of hypertension. It is estimated that this number will rise as the number of patients who are over the age of 65, as well as the number of patients who are obese, continue to increase.  Hypertension is the most common reason for adult office visits other than pregnancy and has the highest use of prescription drugs. Despite the number of resources used to treat this disease, only about 50% of hypertensives have their blood pressure under control using the definition of blood pressure less than 140/90.  Poor adherence to lifestyle changes and medication contribute to this poor outcome. Lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, weight loss, increased exercise and limiting alcohol abuse are difficult when there are no symptoms of the disease until secondary problems arise. It is also difficult to continue medications when drug-related side effects arise when the disease itself is asymptomatic. Inadequate access to medical care for chronic disease, as well as the cost of medication, contribute to poor control of blood pressure. Number of patients over age 60 years with isolated systolic hypertension on drug therapy with a blood pressure reading greater than 150 mmHg systolic (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients over age 60 years with isolated systolic hypertension on drug therapy with a blood pressure reading greater than 150 mmHg systolic who have a plan of care
This measure is used to assess the percentage of cardiac rehabilitation programs in the healthcare system that meet the specified performance measure criteria for assessment of risk for adverse cardiovascular events.A standardized assessment should be performed to identify patients with unstable symptoms and other factors that place the patient at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events. When high-risk findings are noted, a patient should be considered for prompt evaluation and treatment, and rehabilitation recommendations should be adjusted accordingly.  Recurrent adverse cardiovascular events are relatively common in persons with cardiovascular disease (CVD). In one study from Olmsted County, Minnesota, nearly half of patients discharged from the hospital following a myocardial infarction (MI) had a recurrent adverse cardiovascular event in the 3 years following their MI. However, adverse events are rare during cardiac rehabilitation (CR) early after a CVD event, occurring approximately once in every 100,000 patient-hours. This safety record is likely due in part to standard procedures that exist in CR programs to frequently screen patients for signs and symptoms that increase their risk for adverse cardiovascular events. If a CR participant develops abnormal cardiovascular signs (significant arrhythmias or blood pressure abnormalities, for example) or symptoms (exertional chest pain, for instance), they typically receive prompt evaluation and care.  Published reports suggest limited accuracy of the risk stratification methods from the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR), American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), and the American College of Physicians in identifying patients at risk for adverse events during CR sessions. However, one study found that a combination of the AACVPR criteria with a comorbidity index helped improve the accuracy of risk stratification, particularly among female patients. A significant limitation to these studies is the fact that patients identified at high risk undergo additional evaluation and treatment to lower their risk, thereby dampening the ability of such screening measures to accurately identify individuals at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) with documented permanent, persistent, or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who were prescribed an anticoagulant at discharge.    To promote a comprehensive approach to performance improvement, the Stroke and Stroke Rehabilitation Measurement Set is intended for use in its entirety when measuring clinical quality in the care of eligible patients. Full implementation of this measurement set for patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) should always include the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement measure, Radiology: Stenosis Measurement in Carotid Imaging Reports.Patients with atrial fibrillation (either permanent, persistent, or paroxysmal) and stroke should be prescribed an anticoagulant to prevent recurrent strokes.*  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  Administer antithrombotic therapy (oral anticoagulation or aspirin) to all patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), except those with lone AF, to prevent thromboembolism. (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology [ACC/AHA/ESC])  We recommend that clinicians use long-term oral anticoagulation (target INR of 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) for prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation patients who have suffered a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Oral anticoagulation is also beneficial for prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with several other high-risk cardiac sources. (American College of Chest Physicians [ACCP])  For patients with ischemic stroke or TIA with persistent or paroxysmal AF, anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin (target INR, 2.5; range 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended. (American Stroke Association [ASA]) All patients aged 18 years and older with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) with documented permanent, persistent, or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who were prescribed an anticoagulant at discharge (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period who were screened for tobacco use AND who received tobacco cessation counseling intervention if identified as a tobacco user.There is good evidence that tobacco screening and brief cessation intervention (including counseling and pharmacotherapy) in the primary care setting is successful in helping tobacco users quit.  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  Smoking cessation and avoidance of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke at work and home is recommended. Follow-up, referral to special programs, and/or pharmacotherapy (including nicotine replacement) is recommended, as is a stepwise strategy for smoking cessation (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange).  All physicians should strongly advise every patient who smokes to quit because evidence shows that physician advice to quit smoking increases abstinence rates.  Minimal interventions lasting less than 3 minutes increase overall tobacco abstinence rates. Every tobacco user should be offered at least a minimal intervention whether or not he or she is referred to an intensive intervention.  The combination of counseling and medication is more effective for smoking cessation than either medication or counseling alone. Therefore, whenever feasible and appropriate, both counseling and medication should be provided to patients trying to quit smoking. All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who were screened for tobacco use AND who received tobacco cessation counseling intervention if identified as a tobacco user (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is a procedure that requires technical proficiency with the use of complex equipment. Technical errors may lead to clinically significant complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and death.   The frequency of CABG has been relatively stable over the past 15 years, as percutaneous coronary interventions have become more popular. Approximately 366,000 CABG were performed in the USA in 1997 (13.5 per 10,000 persons). Approximately 427,000 CABG were performed in the USA in 2004 (14.6 per 10,000 persons). States (CA, MA, NJ, NY, PA) which publish hospital-specific report cards for CABG performed significantly fewer (p=0.05) procedures (113.8  31.8 per million capita) than non-reporting states (152  62.6 per million capita).   Our empirical analysis found a mean of 399 procedures per year. A substantial number of hospitals perform at least one procedure, and a range of hospitals (68 percent to 88 percent) are considered high volume, depending on the threshold for hospital volume used. Higher volumes of CABG have been associated with better outcomes, namely fewer deaths. While several studies have demonstrated this relationship, these studies also have some flaws. Differences in case-mix and the extremely low proportion of procedures taking place in low volume hospitals may account for some of the differences between high volume and low volume hospital.   The volume-outcome relationship on which this indicator is based may not hold over time, as providers become more experienced or as technology changes. It is important then to revisit the volume-outcome relationship to ensure the validity of this indicator. Overall, volume measures are not direct measures of quality, and are relatively insensitive. For this reason they should be used with caution and in conjunction with measures of mortality and of quality of care within that field (in this case cardiac care), to ensure that increasing volumes truly improve patient outcomes.  Our empirical analyses found that most CABG procedures are actually performed at high volume hospitals already. This leaves little room for improvement. Further, most hospitals are high volume. It is unclear whether simply increasing volume at the few remaining low volume hospitals would actually improve outcomes. It is possible that hospitals could increase volume simply by increasing the number of borderline or inappropriate procedures performed. For this reason, it may be prudent to examine this indicator alongside area rates for this procedure, and examinations of the appropriateness of the procedures.   Note: The following caveats affect the validity of this indicator:        Proxy: Indicator does not directly measure patient outcomes but an aspect of care that is associated with the outcome; thus, it is best used with other indicators that measure similar aspects of care. This concern has been demonstrated in the literature.       Easily manipulated: Use of the indicator may create perverse incentives to improve performance on the indicator without truly improving quality of care. This concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.    This measure applies to providers of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (one provider at a time). Discharges, age 18 years and older, with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.The estimated acute myocardial infarction (AMI) incidence in 2011 will be 610,000 new attacks and 325,000 recurrent attacks. Reductions in the mortality rate for AMI on both the patient-level and the provider-level has been related to better processes of care. Timely and effective treatments are essential for patient outcome, and include appropriate use of thrombolytic therapy and when appropriate, revascularization. The evidence surrounding the validity of AMI mortality as a quality indicator is substantial.   Reductions in the mortality rate for AMI on both the patient level and the provider-level has been related to better processes of care. Timely and effective treatments are essential for patient outcome, and include appropriate use of thrombolytic therapy and when appropriate, revascularization.   Risk adjustment may be important for this indicator. Our empirical results show substantial impact of risk adjustment, particularly at the extremes. This means that without risk adjustment, some providers may be mislabeled as outliers. In addition, some of the potential risk adjustment factors, such as clinical measures, may not be available using administrative data. Methods such as chart review may help illuminate the need for more detailed risk adjustment, and potential case-mix differences between providers. Since AMI is an urgent medical condition, this indicator is not expected to be subject to selection bias.   Hospital discharge practices differ, with some hospitals discharging patients earlier than others. For this reason, this indicator should be considered in conjunction with length of stay and transfer rates (though transfers are excluded in this indicator).  All discharges, age 18 years and older, with a principal diagnosis code of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of deaths among cases meeting the inclusion and exclusion rules for the denominator
This measure is used to assess the percentage of female patients age 44 years and older who have lipid screening every five years. The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the rate of patients up-to-date with Level I preventive services.  Level I preventive services are worthy of attention at every opportunity. Busy clinicians cannot deliver this many services in any single encounter. However, with systems in place to track whether or not patients are up-to-date with the high-priority preventive services for their age group, clinicians can recommend the high-priority services as opportunities present.  Lipid testing is recommended because elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL), elevated triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) are important risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). Treatment of these risk factors is readily available and significantly decreases the risk for CHD. Number of female patients age 44 years and older Number of female patients age 44 years and older who had lipid screening every five years
This measure is used to assess the risk-adjusted rate of all cause in-hospital death occurring within 30 days of first admission to an acute care hospital for individuals 20 to 105 years with a diagnosis of stroke.Stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases are the third leading cause of mortality in Canada after cancer and heart disease, causing about 15,000 deaths every year. Many patients who survive a stroke are left with disability. The impact of a stroke depends on what part of the brain is affected and how severe the damage is. The effects can range from mild impairments to devastating loss of abilities, including mobility, speech, vision or memory. These disabling effects of stroke leave more than half of stroke survivors needing some assistance from others in their day-to-day activities.  Stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability. Adjusted mortality rates following stroke may reflect the underlying effectiveness of treatment and quality of care. Inter-regional variations in the stroke mortality rates may be due to jurisdictional and institutional differences in standards of care, as well as other factors that are not included in the adjustment.  Risk-adjusted mortality rates following stroke may reflect, for example, the severity of the stroke, the underlying effectiveness of treatment and quality of care. There is an increasing body of evidence and guidelines about improving treatment for stroke patients, such as the recent "Canadian Best Practice Recommendations for Stroke Care (Update 2008)," developed by a panel of experts from across the country. Variations in stroke mortality rates may reflect differences in standards of care, as well as other factors, such as early recognition of symptoms and seeking medical care as quickly as possible. Monitoring the percentage of patients who die in hospital after a stroke can be used to review practice patterns, evaluate progress and initiate improvements in care. Total number of stroke episodes in an 11-month period (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of deaths from all causes occurring in hospital within 30 days of admission for stroke
This measure* is used to assess the percent of acute ischemic stroke patients 18 years of age and older who arrive at the hospital within 120 minutes (2 hours) of time last known well and for whom intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV r-TPA or t-PA) was initiated at the hospital within 180 minutes (3 hours) of time last known well.  *This is a Joint Commission only measure.The administration of thrombolytic agents to carefully screened, eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke has been shown to be beneficial in several clinical trials. These included two positive randomized controlled trials in the United States (U.S.): the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Studies, Part I and Part II. Based on the results of these studies, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV r-TPA or t-PA) for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke when given within 3 hours of stroke symptom onset. A large meta-analysis controlling for factors associated with stroke outcome confirmed the benefit of IV tPA in patients treated within 3 hours of symptom onset. While controversy still exists among some specialists, the major society practice guidelines developed in the U.S. all recommend the use of IV t-PA for eligible patients. Physicians with experience and skill in stroke management and the interpretation of computed tomography (CT) scans should supervise treatment. Acute ischemic stroke patients whose time of arrival is within 2 hours (less than or equal to 120 minutes) of time last known well (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Acute ischemic stroke patients for whom intravenous (IV) thrombolytic therapy was initiated at the hospital within 3 hours (less than or equal to 180 minutes) of time last known well
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and over initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke who undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan within 25 minutes of arrival in the emergency department.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and over receiving appropriate thrombolytic and appropriate antithrombotic therapy for ischemic stroke (tissue plasminogen activator [tPA] and aspirin, other antiplatelet agents, or an anticoagulant).  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommendation for the timing of "door to initiation of computed tomography [CT] scan" for thrombolytic candidates is within 25 minutes. Number of patients presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients who had a computed tomography (CT) scan within 25 minutes of arrival in the emergency department
The measure is used to assess the proportion of stroke patients in each risk-adjusted group, ages 16 years and older, that make at least one level of progress on the Augmentative-Alternative Communication Functional Communication Measure (FCM).    The Augmentative-Alternative Communication FCM is one of 15 FCM scales which are used to measure outcomes of speech and language therapy in the realm of swallowing and 14 areas of communication over time.  Each scale is composed of seven-point ratings ranging from least functional (level 1) to most functional (level 7).Changes in Functional Communication Measure (FCM) level provide information on the benefits of treatment designed to enhance functional communication and swallowing.  FCMs were designed to describe aspects of a patient's functional communication and swallowing abilities over time from admission to discharge in various speech-language pathology treatment settings. Stroke patients, ages 16 years and older, with a treatment plan recommending speech and language intervention for a minimum of two sessions. Patients must receive speech and language intervention using either an individual and/or group treatment model or a training and/or consultation model.  See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients 18 to 75 years of age with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who had an eye exam (retinal) performed.  This measure is a component of the Comprehensive Adult Diabetes Care composite measureone of 7 different rateslooking at how well an organization cares for the common and serious chronic disease of diabetes.   Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC): For this measure, there are both Electronic and Hybrid Specifications. This NQMC measure summary is based on the Electronic specification. Refer to the original measure documentation for details pertaining to the Hybrid specification.Diabetes is one of the most costly and highly prevalent chronic diseases in the United States. Approximately 20.8 million Americans have diabetes, and half these cases are undiagnosed (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2005). Complications from the disease cost the country nearly $100 billion annually. In addition, diabetes accounts for nearly 20 percent of all deaths in people over 25. Many complications, such as amputation, blindness and kidney failure, can be prevented if detected and addressed in the early stages. Patients 18 to 75 years of age as of December 31 of the measurement year with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) An eye screening for diabetic retinal disease as identified by electronic data. This includes diabetics who had one of the following:        A retinal or dilated eye exam by an eye care professional (optometrist or ophthalmologist) in the measurement year, or       A negative retinal or dilated eye exam (negative for retinopathy) by an eye care professional in the year prior to the measurement year     See the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field. 
This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients with:        Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or       A 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk greater than or equal to 10%, or       Diabetes       On lipid-lowering medication, and       Most recent low-density lipoprotein (LDL) greater than 100 mg/dL, who are prescribed a maximal recommended dose of a potent statin (such as simvastatin, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin or atorvastatin).   The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk greater than or equal to 10%, or diabetes and on lipid-lowering therapy who remain on the medication therapy.  Patients with risk factors for coronary heart disease but no history of disease who receive lipid-lowering therapy are likely to experience a decreased risk of coronary heart disease (Sever et al., 2003; "Major outcomes," 2002; Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group, 2002; Shepherd et al., 2002; Pignone, Phillips,  Mulrow, 2000; Downs et al., 1998; Shepherd et al., 1995; Frick et al., 1987; Lipid Research Clinics Program, 1984).  Patients with a history of coronary disease (including unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction) often benefit from treatment with a statin. Studies have consistently shown a decrease in risk of death from coronary heart disease (Cannon et al., 2004; Nissen et al., 2004; Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group, 2002; Shepherd et al., 2002; LaRosa, He,  Vupputuri, 1999; Goldberg et al., 1998; The Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) Study Group, 1998; Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study Group, 1994).  Reducing LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels is the primary approach to lowering risk of CHD in both primary and secondary prevention. Statins are the drugs of choice for lowering LDL-C, and aggressive treatment with statins should be pursued. Seven statins are available: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, pitavastatin.  Poor adherence can limit the effectiveness of therapies. In asymptomatic conditions such as hyperlipidemia, this can be especially problematic. Long-term adherence to drug therapy for chronic conditions is estimated to be only about 50%. Adherence in clinical trials is often much higher, due to multiple factors including patient selection, close monitoring and educational efforts of medical staff.  Patients with (a) established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or (b) 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk greater than or equal to 10%, or (c) diabetes and most recent low-density lipoprotein (LDL) greater than 100 mg/dL and are prescribed lipid-lowering medication (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)  Patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) greater than 100 who are prescribed a maximal recommended dose of a potent statin (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) 
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease with systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) (ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%) who are prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with stable coronary artery disease with systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) (ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%), including those patients with a comorbidity diagnosis of chronic kidney disease and/or diabetes mellitus.  Among patients with stable angina, ACE inhibitors are most beneficial to patients with left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction, persistent hypertension and diabetes. Patients with normal left ventricular function who also have hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease should be on ACE inhibitors. If the patient cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors, a potential substitute would be ARBs.  A meta-analysis of five placebo randomized controlled trials involving different ACE inhibitors showed reduction in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, as well as myocardial infarction, that were statistically significant. The degree of benefit needs to be assessed individually and may depend on patient characteristics. Number of stable coronary artery disease patients with systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) (ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients who had a prescription for an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of hospitalized patients 18 years and older who have a baseline international normalized ratio when initially prescribed warfarin.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to improve the safety of using medications by reducing the likelihood of patient harm associated with the use of anticoagulation therapy in inpatient care settings for patients 18 years of age and older.

Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.The diagnostic evaluation of patients with presumptive coronary artery disease often involves cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography. Bilateral cardiac catheterization is considered appropriate in the presence of certain clinical indications: suspected pulmonary hypertension or significant right sided valvular abnormalities, heart failure, cardiomyopathies, congenital heart disease, pericardial disease, and cardiac transplantation. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, though, has published guidelines for cardiac catheterization laboratories stating that "without specific indications, 'routine' right heart catheterizationsare unnecessary."  Right side coronary catheterization incidental to left side catheterization has little additional benefit for patients without indications of right side catheterization. Despite guidelines that have been set forth discouraging such practice, the practice continues in some hospitals.   Note: The following caveats affect the validity of the indicator:        Selection bias: This results when a substantial percentage of care for a condition is provided in the outpatient setting, so the subset of inpatient cases may be unrepresentative. Examination of outpatient care or emergency care data may help to reduce this in these cases.       Unclear construct: There is uncertainty or poor correlation with widely accepted process measures.    All discharges, age 18 years and older, with heart catheterization (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of simultaneous right and left heart catheterizations (procedures) among cases meeting the inclusion and exclusion rules for the denominator (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

This measure is used to assess the relative resource use by members with hypertension by reporting total standard cost and service frequency for all services for which the organization has paid or expects to pay during the measurement year.  Note: Organizations must report the Controlling High Blood Pressure (CBP) quality measure when reporting Relative Resource Use for People with Hypertension (RHY).  Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC): Measure specifications reference value sets that must be used for HEDIS reporting. In this NQMC measure summary, value set references are capitalized and underlined. A value set is the complete set of codes used to identify the service or condition included in the measure. Refer to the original measure documentation for the Value Set Directory. How much care costs is an important consideration when choosing a health plan. There is a great demand for information to help purchasers and consumers determine which organizations offer the highest quality services, along with effective management of those services and low premium or out-of-pocket costs.  HEDIS 2014 includes five measures of relative resource use (RRU) for members with specific chronic and acute conditions: diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma.  The measures are a standardized approach to measuring resource use. When evaluated with the corresponding Quality of Care measures, they provide more information about the efficiency or value of services rendered by an organization. Members 18 through 85 years of age as of December 31 of the measurement year with a diagnosis of hypertension (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Total standard cost and service frequency counts for all services for which the organization has paid or expects to pay for the eligible population during the treatment period, reported by age, gender and risk group (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) non-recipients, age 18 years and older, initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke who have hypertension appropriately managed in the first 48 hours of hospitalization or until neurologically stable.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) non-recipients who have hypertension appropriately managed in the first 48 hours of hospitalization or until neurologically stable.  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  Treatment of extreme hypertension in patients in the acute stroke phase is widely accepted based on consensus guidelines showing poor outcomes at the far end of the hypertension spectrum (e.g., systolic 220 mmHg, diastolic 120 mmHg or mean arterial blood pressure [BP] 130 mmHg). There is no definitive information available yet on the effect of altering BP on outcome during the acute stroke phase. Until there is more information available, a recommendation to treat the extreme and monitor and treat where necessary in the less extreme is warranted.  There are rational but also theoretic arguments for reducing elevated BP in the setting of acute ischemic stroke. Lowering the pressure may reduce edema, blood-brain barrier disruption, and conversion to hemorrhagic infarction. Beginning treatment in the acute setting would be a head start in an important pillar of secondary prevention.   Observational studies and reviews not examining deliberate interventions have suggested a U-shaped relationship between BP and various outcomes with poorer outcomes at very low and very high blood pressures and best outcomes around systolic BP 150 mmHg, providing grounds for the current consensus-based guidelines to treat BP if it falls outside of arbitrarily derived thresholds established according to thrombolysis status (see Table 3, "Approach to Elevated Blood Pressure in Acute Ischemic Stroke," in the original measure document). To be anticipated is more research to gather evidence about what the thresholds should actually be.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients, regardless of age, with an emergency department discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who had documentation of receiving aspirin within 24 hours before emergency department arrival or during emergency department stay.The emergency physician should document that the patient received aspirin no matter where or when the aspirin was taken.*  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  Aspirin should be chewed by patients who have not taken aspirin before presentation with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The initial dose should be 162 mg to 325 mg. Although some trials have used enteric-coated aspirin for initial dosing, more rapid buccal absorption occurs with nonenteric-coated aspirin formulations. (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association [ACC/AHA]) All patients, regardless of age, with an emergency department discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who had documentation of receiving aspirin within 24 hours before emergency department arrival or during emergency department stay
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) treated with nimodipine.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.   The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.  Early nimodipine administration is efficacious in reducing ischemic neurologic sequelae in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The efficacy of nimodipine seems to be more related to a direct cellular mechanism than to reduced cerebral vasospasm. Total number of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) admitted to critical care (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) treated with nimodipine (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of hospitalized patients age 18 years and older with venous thromboembolism (VTE) who receive warfarin on day one of heparin therapy.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to prevent progression or recurrence of thromboembolic disease.  It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year.  Warfarin therapy should be begun at the same time as heparin/fondaparinux and continued for a minimum of five days and until the international normalized ratio (INR) is greater than or equal to 2.0 for two consecutive days. The anticoagulant effect of warfarin is delayed until clotting factors already circulating are cleared. Although Factor VII has a shorter half-life in the blood (six to seven hours), peak anticoagulant activity is delayed for up to 96 hours until factors with longer plasma half-lives (II, IX and X) have cleared.

This measure is used to assess percentage of patients age 18 years and older with venous thromboembolism (VTE) who are prescribed unfractionated heparin (UFH) and/or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) who have baseline laboratory tests documented in their medical record: international normalized ratio (INR), blood count including platelets, creatinine, weight and baseline partial thromboplastin time (PTT).The priority aim addressed by this measure is to safely use anticoagulants to reduce the likelihood of patient harm and complications of anticoagulation therapy.  It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year.

Please note: This measure summary will be fully specified once the updated AHRQ User Guide is released in early 2013.Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair requires technical proficiency with using complex equipment on patients who frequently have coexisting coronary artery, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease. Technical errors may lead to clinically significant complications, such as arrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction, colonic ischemia, and death.   AAA is found in 5 percent to 10 percent of men aged 65 to 79 years. The major complication is aortic rupture which presents as a surgical emergency. The mortality after rupture is high, 80 percent for patients reaching hospital and 50 percent for those undergoing surgery for emergency repair. Currently elective surgical repair is recommended for aneurysms discovered to be larger than 5.5 cm to prevent rupture.   AAA repair is a relatively rare procedure. Our empirical analysis found a mean of 14 procedures per year. While a large number of hospitals perform at least one procedure, a range of hospitals (12 to 44 percent) are considered high volume, depending on the threshold for hospital volume used. The relationship between volume and outcome has been established in the literature, specifically that higher volume hospitals have lower mortality than lower volume hospitals; differences in patient case-mix do not account fully for these relationships. Our empirical analysis noted that AAA repair volume was negatively correlated to AAA repair mortality.   The volume-outcome relationship on which this indicator is based may not hold over time, as providers become more experienced or as technology changes. It is important then to revisit the volume-outcome relationship to ensure the validity of this indicator. Overall, volume measures are not direct measures of quality, and are relatively insensitive. For this reason they should be used with caution and in conjunction with other measure of mortality, to ensure that increasing volumes truly improve patient outcome.   Note: The following caveats affect the validity of this indicator:        Performance for this indicator is highly dependent on the volume threshold used.       Proxy: Indicator does not directly measure patient outcomes but an aspect of care that is associated with the outcome; thus, it is best used with other indicators that measure similar aspects of care. This caveat was identified from the literature review.       Easily manipulated: Use of the indicator may create perverse incentives to improve performance on the indicator without truly improving quality of care. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature.    This measure applies to providers of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (one provider at a time). Discharges, age 18 years and older, with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair procedure and a principal or secondary diagnosis of AAA (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percent of heart failure patients 18 years of age and older discharged home with written discharge instructions or educational material given to patient or caregiver at discharge or during the hospital stay addressing all of the following: activity level, diet, discharge medications, follow-up appointment, weight monitoring, and what to do if symptoms worsen.Patient non-compliance with diet and medications is an important reason for changes in clinical status. Health care professionals should ensure that patients and their families understand their dietary restrictions, activity recommendations, prescribed medication regimen, and the signs and symptoms of worsening heart failure. National guidelines strongly support the role of patient education (Jessup et al., 2009; Lindenfeld et al., 2010). Heart failure patients 18 years of age and older discharged to home, home care, or court/law enforcement (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Heart failure patients with documentation that they or their caregivers were given written discharge instructions or other educational material addressing all of the following:        Activity level       Diet       Discharge medications       Follow-up appointment       Weight monitoring       What to do if symptoms worsen   
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage for whom consideration of rehabilitation services is documented.  To promote a comprehensive approach to performance improvement, the Stroke and Stroke Rehabilitation Measurement Set is intended for use in its entirety when measuring clinical quality in the care of eligible patients. Full implementation of this measurement set for patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) should always include the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement measure, Radiology: Stenosis Measurement in Carotid Imaging Reports.All patients should be considered for rehabilitation services to meet the individual patient needs.*  *The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:  Strongly recommend that patients in need of rehabilitation services have access to a setting with a coordinated and organized rehabilitation care team that is experienced in providing stroke services. The coordination and organization of inpatient postacute stroke care will improve patient outcome. (Veterans Administration/Department of Defense [VA/DoD]) All patients aged 18 years and older with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage Patients for whom consideration of rehabilitation services is documented (ordered rehabilitation or documented that rehabilitation was not indicated) (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older who had a stroke with documentation of screening for major depression or persistent depressive disorder using Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2).The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the assessment for major depression or persistent depressive disorder of primary care patients presenting with any additional high-risk conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, post-stroke, chronic pain and all perinatal women.  At any given time, 9% of the population has a depressive disorder, and 3.4% has major depression (Strine et al., 2008). In a 12-month time period, 6.6% of the U.S. population will have experienced major depression, and 16.6% of the population will experience depression in their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005).  Major depression is a treatable cause of pain, suffering, disability and death, yet primary care clinicians detect major depression in only one-third to one-half of their patients with major depression (Williams et al., 2002; Schonfeld et al., 1997). Additionally, more than 80% of patients with depression have a medical comorbidity (Klinkman, 2003). Usual care for depression in the primary care setting has resulted in only about half of depressed adults getting treated (Kessler et al., 2005) and only 20% to 40% showing substantial improvement over 12 months (Untzer et al., 2002; Katon et al., 1999). Approximately 70% to 80% of antidepressants are prescribed in primary care, making it critical that clinicians know how to use them and have a system that supports best practices (Mojtabai  Olfson, 2008).  The importance of the interplay between depression and many medical comorbidities cannot be overstated. A long list of medical conditions has been associated with increased risk for depression; these include chronic pain, diabetes, cancer, HIV, Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis, to name a few (Kozhimannil, Pereira,  Harlow, 2009; Egede, 2005; Katon et al., 2004).  A recent meta-analysis (Pan et al., 2011) affirms earlier (O'Donnell et al., 2010; Van der Kooy et al., 2007) findings of an association between depression and stroke. The pooled hazard ratio from the Pan study was 1.45, on par with the association between smoking and stroke, and obesity and stroke. The authors suggest potential causative mechanisms similar to those for cardiovascular disease.  Either the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) or the PHQ-9 can be used to screen for depression. There is stronger evidence supporting the use of the PHQ-9 in patients with chronic disease. The PHQ two-question tool (PHQ-2) should be used in routine screening settings (Gilbody et al., 2006). If the patient answers "yes" to either of the two questions, the full PHQ-9 depression instrument should be administered (Kroenke et al., 2010). Number of patients age 18 years and older who had a stroke and at least one contact with a clinician in primary care in the last 12 months from the measurement date (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)  Number of patients screened for depression symptoms (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke who are admitted to a hospital unit with ischemic stroke for whom patient/family education is documented in the medical record.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to improve patient and family education of patients with ischemic stroke in both the emergency department and the admitting hospital unit.  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.  A process should be in place for educating the patient and family to the suspected diagnosis, emergency department process, tests to be performed, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment and its risks, and other treatment measures to be considered. This could include face-to-face interaction by the caregiver with the patient and family, as well as teaching tools in written form. Education should be documented in the medical record. Number of patients presenting with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients who have education documentation
This measure is used to assess the number of patients diagnosed with confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) who received an overlap of parenteral (intravenous [IV] or subcutaneous [subcu]) anticoagulation and warfarin therapy. For patients who received less than five days of overlap therapy, they must be discharged on both medications or have a Reason for Discontinuation of Parenteral Therapy. Overlap therapy must be administered for at least five days with an international normalized ratio (INR) greater than or equal to 2 prior to discontinuation of the parenteral anticoagulation therapy, or the patient must be discharged on both medications or have a Reason for Discontinuation of Parenteral Therapy.For patients who present with a confirmed acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), parenteral anticoagulation is the first line of therapy because of its rapid onset of action (Buller et al., 2004). Warfarin can be initiated on the first day of treatment after the first dose of a parenteral anticoagulant has been given. Because the warfarin has a very slow onset of action, it cannot be used as mono-therapy for acute VTE (Ansell et al., 2008).   The strong (Level I) recommendations to overlap parenteral anticoagulation with oral warfarin therapy in the initial treatment of VTE events is based in part on the known effect of warfarin on the coagulation cascade (Brandjes et al., 1992). The early increase in the prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) often reflects the laboratory finding of initial reduction in clotting factors of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation resulting in prolongation of the PT/INR, while the patient is still at risk of thromboembolic events due to persistent levels of coagulation factors of the intrinsic pathway and common pathways of coagulation.   The recommendation that heparins and warfarin overlap for a five-day period is based on pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic, pathophysiologic, and clinical evidence as noted by A.K. Wittkowsky (2005). All studies support the pharmacokinetic characteristics of warfarin and the time delay in achieving an antithrombotic effect suggesting the need for overlap of heparin during initial warfarin dosing in order to prevent thrombus extension, embolization to the lungs, death due to pulmonary emboli (PE), and the development of complications such as recurrent thromboembolic events and the postthrombotic syndrome. Kearon et al. 2008 also denotes current recommendation for treatment of confirmed VTE to begin with oral warfarin therapy, with combination of initial anticoagulation therapy for a minimum of 5 days and until the INR is greater than 2.0 for at least 24 hours, and then a recommended target rate.  Patients with confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) who received warfarin (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who received overlap therapy (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of eligible inpatients with a qualifying event/diagnosis (acute myocardial infarction [AMI] or chronic stable angina [CSA], or who during hospitalization have undergone coronary artery bypass graft [CABG] surgery, a percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], cardiac valve surgery, or cardiac transplantation) who have been referred to an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program prior to hospital discharge or have a documented medical or patient-centered reason why such a referral was not made.There has been growing scientific evidence over the past 3 decades on the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) services for persons with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence suggests that the benefits of CR services are as significant in recent years as they were in the prethrombolytic era. Because of this mounting evidence, a number of healthcare organizations have endorsed the use of CR services in persons with CVD by including provisions for CR in their practice guidelines and practice management position papers.  Despite both the known benefits of CR and the widespread endorsement of its use, CR is vastly underutilized, with less than 30% of eligible patients participating in a CR program after a CVD event. Reasons for this gap in CR participation are numerous, but the most critical and potentially most correctable reasons revolve around obstacles in the initial referral of patients to CR programs. These obstacles can be reduced through the systematic adoption of standing orders and other similar tools for CR referral for appropriate hospitalized patients. Furthermore, physician accountability associated with the use of these performance measures may lead to new and novel approaches to improve both referral rates and the outcome of patients with CVD.  A key component to outpatient CR program utilization is the appropriate and timely referral of patients. Generally, the most important time for this referral to take place is while the patient is hospitalized for a qualifying event/diagnosis (myocardial infarction [MI], chronic stable angina [CSA], coronary artery bypass graft [CABG] surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], cardiac valve surgery, or cardiac transplantation).  This performance measure has been developed to help healthcare systems implement effective steps in their systems of care that will optimize the appropriate referral of a patient to an outpatient CR program.  This measure is designed to serve as a stand-alone measure or, preferably, to be included within other performance measurement sets that involve disease states or other conditions for which CR services have been found to be appropriate and beneficial (e.g., following MI, CABG surgery).  Effective referral of appropriate inpatients to an outpatient CR program is the responsibility of the healthcare team within a healthcare system that is primarily responsible for providing cardiovascular care to the patient during the hospitalization. Number of hospitalized patients in the reporting period hospitalized with a qualifying event/diagnosis who do not meet any of the specified exclusion criteria (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of eligible patients with a qualifying event/diagnosis who have been referred to an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program prior to hospital discharge or have a documented medical or patient-centered reason why such a referral was not made (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of emergency department (ED) patients 18 years and older with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or chest pain who received aspirin within 24 hours before ED arrival or prior to transfer.The early use of aspirin in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) results in a significant reduction in adverse events and subsequent mortality. The benefits of aspirin therapy on mortality are comparable to fibrinolytic therapy. The combination of aspirin and fibrinolytics provides additive benefits for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ("Randomised trial," 1988). Aspirin is also effective in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (Theroux et al., 1988; "Risk of myocardial infarction," 1990). National guidelines strongly recommend early aspirin for patients hospitalized with AMI (Antman et al., 2008; Wright et al., 2011). Patients 18 years and older with an emergency department (ED) encounter who were discharged/transferred to a short-term general hospital for inpatient care, or to a Federal healthcare facility, with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or angina, acute coronary syndrome, or chest pain (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Emergency department (ED) acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or chest pain patients (with Probable Cardiac Chest Pain) who received aspirin within 24 hours before ED arrival or prior to transfer (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure is used to assess the percentage of discharged patients 18 years and older who are readmitted to the hospital with venous thromboembolism within 30 days of discharge.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to reduce the risk of complications from pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for hospitalized and discharged patients 18 years of age and older. Number of adult patients who are discharged after hospitalization for a medical condition or surgery (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of adult discharged patients who are readmitted to the hospital with venous thromboembolism within 30 days of discharge
This measure is used to assess the median time from arrival to administration of fibrinolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed closest to hospital arrival time. This measure rate should be analyzed in conjunction with the measure rate for the related measure, Acute myocardial infarction (AMI): percent of patients with ST-segment elevation or LBBB on the ECG closet to arrival time receiving fibrinolytic therapy during the hospital stay and having a time from hospital arrival to fibrinolysis of 30 minutes or less. These measures, used together, will assist in understanding the median time to fibrinolysis and will identify the number of AMI patients that are receiving fibrinolysis within 30 minutes of hospital arrival and potential opportunities for improvement to decrease the median time to fibrinolysis.Time to fibrinolytic therapy is a strong predictor of outcome in patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Nearly 2 lives per 1000 patients are lost per hour of delay (Fibrinolytic Therapy Trialists' Collaborative Group, 1994). National guidelines recommend that fibrinolytic therapy be given within 30 minutes of hospital arrival in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (American College of Emergency Physicianset al., 2013). Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed closest to hospital arrival who received fibrinolytic therapy within 6 hours after hospital arrival and the fibrinolytic therapy is primary reperfusion therapy (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Continuous variable statement: Time (in minutes) from hospital arrival to administration of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed closest to hospital arrival
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with documentation in the medical record of receiving a pneumonia vaccination according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease who receive education and an intervention for modifiable risk factors.  Modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease need to be evaluated and may include smoking, inadequate physical activity, depression, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Intervention involving any risk factor pertinent to the patient is encouraged and may include education, goal setting, and follow-up as necessary. For all patients, lifestyle modification, including exercise, smoking cessation, achieving and maintaining ideal body weight, and proven risk factor reduction will continue to be the focus of primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention.  It is recommended that pneumonia vaccination be administered according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2010 Updated Recommendations for Prevention of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease Among Adults. Using the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) for patients between 19 to 64 years old with diagnosis of chronic stable angina (chronic heart disease), a PPSV23 should be administered at the time of diagnosis, and another dose of PPSV23 should be repeated when the patients become 65 years old or later if at least five years have passed since their previous dose. Those who receive PPSV23 at or after age 65 years should receive only a single dose. Number of stable coronary artery disease patients (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of stable coronary artery disease patients who had documented pneumonia vaccination
This measure* is used to assess the percent of ischemic stroke patients 18 years of age and older with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL, or LDL not measured, or who were on a lipid-lowering medication prior to hospital arrival, who are prescribed a statin medication at hospital discharge  *This is a Joint Commission only measure.An elevated serum lipid level has been a well-documented risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and reflects an organ-specific manifestation of atherosclerosis, which is a disease process that can affect the heart and the major and minor branches of the arterial tree. The reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, through lifestyle modification and drug therapy when appropriate, is recommended for the prevention of myocardial infarction and other major vascular events for patients with CAD (or coronary risk equivalent conditions) according to the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATPIII) Guidelines. Recently, there has been an increased focus on the detection of patients with these risk factors when they present with other manifestations of atherosclerosis, and assuring that these patients are treated with lipid lowering medication if they meet NCEP ATPIII guidelines. While symptomatic carotid artery disease is one of the recognized coronary disease risk equivalents that qualify patients for treatment under ATPIII, there was little data until recently about the role of lipid lowering to prevent recurrent stroke or major vascular events in patients who presented with atherosclerotic stroke but did not otherwise qualify for treatment under ATPIII. The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study examined the effects of statins to lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) of atherosclerotic origin who had no other reason for taking lipid lowering therapy (i.e., they were without prior CAD or risk equivalent conditions), and had a fasting LDL greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL. The trial convincingly demonstrated that intensive lipid lowering therapy using statin medication was associated with a dramatic reduction in the rate of recurrent ischemic stroke and major coronary events. The treatment was well tolerated and cost effective. As a result, intensive lipid-lowering therapy through use of a statin medication is now recommended for all patients with stroke or TIA of atherosclerotic origin who have an LDL greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL (or with LDL less than 100 mg/dL due to being on lipid-lowering therapy prior to admission).  Based on these guidelines, all patients with ischemic stroke or TIA should have lipid profile measurement performed within 48 hours of admission unless results are available from within the past 30 days. A large body of evidence suggests that non-fasting lipid levels drawn in the first 48 hours after a major vascular event are reliable predictors of baseline lipid profiles, but after that time they may become unreliable. It is recommended that all patients with ischemic stroke or TIA with coronary heart disease or symptomatic atherosclerotic disease who have an LDL greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL (or with LDL less than 100 mg/dL due to being on lipid-lowering therapy prior to admission) should be treated with a statin. The target goal for cholesterol lowering is an LDL-c level of less than 100 mg/dL. An LDL-c less than 70 mg/dL is recommended for very high-risk persons with multiple risk factors. For patients with stroke of atherosclerotic origin, intensive lipid-lowering therapy with statins should be initiated in those who have an LDL greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL (or with LDL less than 100 mg/dL due to being on lipid lowering therapy prior to admission). Ischemic stroke patients with a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL, or LDL not measured, or who were on a lipid-lowering medication prior to hospital arrival (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Ischemic stroke patients prescribed statin medication at hospital discharge
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure with current left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 35% despite ACE inhibitor/ARB and beta-blocker therapy for at least three months who were counseled regarding implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation as a treatment option for the prophylaxis of sudden death.Heart failure is a chronic condition that poses a major and growing threat to the public's health. Improving the effectiveness of care and optimizing patient outcomes will become increasingly important as the population of the United States ages.  Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) have proven effective at preventing sudden death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias in a clearly defined subset of patients with heart failure. Despite this benefit, the risk of device-site complications and frequent shocks from an ICD can lead to reduced quality of life. As a result, ICD implantation is recommended to be considered in patients with a sustained reduction of ejection fraction (EF) (less than or equal to 35%) despite a course of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and mild to moderate symptoms of heart failure and in whom survival with good functional capacity is otherwise anticipated to extend beyond 1 year. Given the significant benefits and risks of ICD implantation, eligible patients should be fully informed of this treatment option.  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  Placement of an ICD is reasonable in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who are at least 40 days post-MI, have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30% or less, are New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I on chronic optimal medical therapy, and have reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 year.  Patients with reduced LVEF:  ICD therapy is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death to reduce total mortality in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease at least 40 days post-MI, a LVEF less than or equal to 35%, and NYHA functional class II or III symptoms while receiving chronic optimal medical therapy, and who have reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 year.  ICD therapy is indicated in patients with LVEF less than or equal to 35% due to prior MI who are at least 40 days post-MI and are in NYHA functional Class II or III.  ICD therapy is indicated in patients with [left ventricular] dysfunction due to prior MI who are at least 40 days post-MI, have an LVEF less than or equal to 30%, and are in NYHA functional Class I.  All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of heart failure with current left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to 35% despite angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and beta-blocker therapy for at least three months (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients who were counseled regarding implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation as a treatment option for the prophylaxis of sudden death (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
This measure assesses the percent of patients with blood pressure checked at least once within the last three months  among patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) are situated at a crossroads between patients with less severe chronic kidney disease, where strict blood pressure control is a well established mainstay of therapy, and patients on dialysis, where blood pressure goals are not well understood. In the absence of strong scientific data to define therapeutic targets, blood pressure goals in dialysis patients remain extrapolated from the general population. Because of significantly increased cardiovascular risk in patients with both advanced CKD and diabetes, management of patients with both conditions deserves special attention.  Several observational studies have demonstrated that patients with advanced CKD are at high risk for hypertension. Patients with advanced CKD who are also hypertensive usually have blood pressures elevated above recommended guidelines, even if treated with antihypertensives. In order to be treated appropriately, blood pressure must first be assessed and hypertension recognized. The number of adult patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), not currently receiving renal replacement therapy The number of patients from the denominator with blood pressure checked at least once within the last three months (90 days)
This measure is used to assess the percent of heart failure patients 18 years of age and older with documentation in the hospital record that left ventricular systolic (LVS) function was evaluated before arrival, during hospitalization, or is planned for after discharge.Appropriate selection of medications to reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure requires the identification of patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function. National guidelines advocate the evaluation of left ventricular systolic function as the single most important diagnostic test in the management of all patients with heart failure (Jessup et al., 2009; Lindenfeld et al., 2010). Heart failure patients 18 years of age and older (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Heart failure patients with documentation in the hospital record that left ventricular systolic (LVS) function was evaluated before arrival, during hospitalization, or is planned for after discharge
This measure is used to assess percentage of patients discharged from the critical care department with a main diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) who died.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.   The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.  Although mortality from acute coronary syndrome (ACS) depends on many factors, it is associated with the levels of treatment that the patient receives, so we continue to consider this an indicator of the quality of care.

This measure is used to assess the percent of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 18 years of age and older who are prescribed aspirin at hospital discharge.Aspirin therapy in patients who have suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) reduces the risk of adverse events and mortality. Studies have demonstrated that aspirin can reduce this risk by 20% ("Collaborative overview," 1994). National guidelines strongly recommend long-term aspirin for the secondary prevention of subsequent cardiovascular events in eligible older patients discharged after AMI (American College of Emergency Physicianset al., 2013; Jneid et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2011).

This measure is used to assess the percentage of correctly monitored continuous renal replacement (CRR) therapy treatments.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.  The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality. In the case of intensive care medicine, this interest in quality is even more evident, not only because of its social and economic impact, but also because some of the dimensions involved in the quality of care of critical patients take on greater importance: critical patients are more vulnerable, access to critical care is more limited so efforts to distribute resources equitably are more important, scant scientific evidence is available, and the efficiency is limited.  Although continuous renal replacement (CRR) therapy has not proven more effective than intermittent dialysis techniques in reducing mortality, it may lead to better outcome (better tolerance) and be more suitable given the resources available for critical patients. CRR therapy is especially indicated for patients with cardiovascular dysfunction, multiple organ failure, or intracranial hypertension. Some parameters should be monitored to ensure the effectiveness and safety of continuous techniques.

This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk greater than or equal to 10%, or diabetes and on lipid-lowering medication who has a fasting lipid panel within 24 months of medication prescription.The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk greater than or equal to 10%, or diabetes and on lipid-lowering therapy who remain on the medication therapy.  Patients with risk factors for coronary heart disease but no history of disease who receive lipid-lowering therapy are likely to experience a decreased risk of coronary heart disease (Sever et al., 2003; "Major outcomes," 2002; Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group, 2002; Shepherd et al., 2002; Pignone, Phillips,  Mulrow, 2000; Downs et al., 1998; Shepherd et al., 1995; Frick et al., 1987; Lipid Research Clinics Program, 1984).  Patients with a history of coronary disease (including unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction) often benefit from treatment with a statin. Studies have consistently shown a decrease in risk of death from coronary heart disease (Cannon et al., 2004; Nissen et al., 2004; Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group, 2002; Shepherd et al., 2002; LaRosa, He,  Vupputuri, 1999; Goldberg et al., 1998; The Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) Study Group, 1998; Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study Group, 1994).  Poor adherence can limit the effectiveness of therapies. In asymptomatic conditions such as hyperlipidemia, this can be especially problematic. Long-term adherence to drug therapy for chronic conditions is estimated to be only about 50%. Adherence in clinical trials is often much higher, due to multiple factors including patient selection, close monitoring and educational efforts of medical staff. Patients with (a) established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), (b) 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk greater than or equal to 10%, or (c) diabetes (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)  Patients who have a fasting lipid panel within 24 months of prescription for lipid-lowering medication
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS) who receive reperfusion treatment.The aim of intensive care medicine is to provide critical patients with the healthcare that they need, ensuring the quality and safety of care. Intensive care medicine is one of the principal components of modern healthcare systems. There is an increasing demand for this resource, which involves high costs.  The quality of care has gradually come to be the central focus of healthcare, and in recent years patient safety has come to represent one of the key aspects of quality.

Reperfusion with thrombolytic treatment or primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) reduces the size of the infarct, improves ventricular function, and reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS).

This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes with optimally managed modifiable risk factors:        Blood pressure less than 140/90 mmHg       Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) less than 100 mg/dl       Hemoglobin A1c (HBA1c) less than 8       Daily aspirin use for diabetes patients with a co-morbidity of ischemic vascular disease unless contraindicated       Documented tobacco-free status   According to the Minnesota Department of Health, diabetes is a high impact clinical condition in Minnesota. More than one in three adults and one in six youth in Minnesota have diabetes or are at high risk of developing it. Each year more than 20,000 Minnesotans are newly diagnosed with diabetes. Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death in Minnesota and is a significant risk factor in developing cardiovascular disease and stroke, non-traumatic lower extremity amputations, blindness, and end-stage renal disease. Diabetes costs Minnesota almost $2.7 billion annually, including medical care, lost productivity and premature mortality. According to the American Diabetes Association, an estimated 23.6 million American children and adults have diabetes. Most people with diabetes have other risk factors, such as high blood pressure and cholesterol that increase the risk for heart disease and stroke. In fact, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from these complications. Eligible patients age 18 to 75 with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (see the related "Denominator Inclusion/Exclusions" field) The number of diabetes patients who meet all of the following targets for optimally managed modifiable risk factors:        Blood pressure less than 140/90 mmHg       Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) less than 100 mg/dl       Hemoglobin A1c (HBA1c) less than 8       Daily aspirin use for diabetes patients with a co-morbidity of ischemic vascular disease unless contraindicated       Documented tobacco-free status     See the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.
This measure* estimates a hospital-level risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) for patients discharged from the hospital with a principal diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).  *This is a Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) only measure.The Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) developed the acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 30-day mortality measure to complement the existing AMI process of care measures. Risk-standardized mortality rates (RSMRs) can provide important additional information about quality of care that is not currently captured by the process measures and is currently unavailable to hospitals. Variation in mortality, after adjusting for case-mix, may reflect differences in hospitals' general environments (such as coordination of care, patient safety policies, and staffing) or variation in care processes not measured in the current core measure set. Outcome measures can focus attention on a broader set of healthcare activities that affect patients' well-being. Moreover, improving outcomes is the ultimate goal of quality improvement, and so the inclusion of outcomes measures assists in attaining improvement goals.  AMI is a common condition with substantial mortality and morbidity and is part of the core measure set currently reported. The condition imposes a substantial burden on patients and the health care system, and there is marked variation in outcomes by institution. The measure cohort consists of admissions for Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) and Veterans Health Administration (VA) beneficiaries aged 65 years or older and discharged from non-federal acute care hospitals or VA hospitals, having a principal discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).  The hospital-specific risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" deaths to the number of "expected" deaths, multiplied by the national unadjusted mortality rate. The "denominator" is the number of deaths expected on the basis of the nation's performance with that hospital's case-mix.  See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.  Note: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the measure cohort.  See the 2013 Measures Updates and Specifications: Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and Pneumonia 30-Day Risk-Standardized Mortality Measures for more details. The measure counts death from any cause within 30 days after the index admission date.  The hospital-specific risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" deaths to the number of "expected" deaths, multiplied by the national unadjusted mortality rate. The "numerator" of the ratio is the number of deaths within 30 days predicted on the basis of the hospital's performance with its observed case-mix.  Note: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the outcome.  See the 2013 Measures Updates and Specifications: Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and Pneumonia 30-Day Risk-Standardized Mortality Measures for more details.
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with a current diagnosis of heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction who are currently treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) who are additionally currently treated with a beta-blocker licensed for heart failure.Heart failure (HF) represents the only major cardiovascular disease with increasing prevalence and is responsible for dramatic impairment of quality of life, carries a poor prognosis for patients and is very costly for the National Health Service (NHS) to treat (second only to stroke). This indicator set refers to all patients with HF unless specified otherwise.  The evidence base for treating HF due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) with beta blockers (Deedwania et al., 2005; The Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II, 1999) is at least as strong as the evidence base guiding the HF004 indicator on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) (level 1a), with a 34 per cent reduction in major endpoints of beta-blockers on top of ACE-I compared to placebo and is a standard recommendation in all HF guidelines, including National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The belief that beta-blockers are contraindicated in HF was disproved, at least for the licensed beta-blockers, in the late 1990s and in some countries (especially in Scandinavia) beta-blockers have never been contraindicated in HF. Furthermore, there are no data to suggest excess risk in the elderly (SENIORS with nebivolol only randomised patients aged over 70 with significant benefits and no safety signal) and there are no contraindications for use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  However, despite the evidence above, initiating beta-blockers in HF, or switching from one not licensed for HF, is more difficult because of the need to titrate from low doses and small increments over repeated visits. Patients also often suffer a temporary deterioration in symptoms with beta-blocker initiation which needs monitoring.  The British National Formulary (BNF) states that "the beta-blockers bisoprolol and carvedilol are of value in any grade of stable HF and LVSD; nebivolol is licensed for stable mild to moderate HF in patients aged over 70, beta-blocker treatment should be initiated at a very low dose and titrated very slowly over a period of weeks or months by those experienced in the management of HF. Symptoms may deteriorate initially, calling for adjustment of concomitant therapy" (BNF database, 2013).  NICE clinical guideline CG108 (2010) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) clinical guideline 95 (2007) recommend that beta-blockers licensed for HF are used as first-line therapy in all patients with HF due to LVSD. CG108 recommends that beta-blockers are used in patients with defined co-morbidities such as older adults and those with peripheral vascular disease (PVD), erectile dysfunction (ED), diabetes mellitus (DM), interstitial pulmonary disease and COPD without reversibility. The only co-morbidities with a clear contraindication to beta-blocker use are those with asthma and reversible airways obstruction (these groups were excluded from clinical trials).   Contractors are advised that patients already prescribed an unlicensed beta-blocker prior to diagnosis of HF due to LVSD do not have their drug therapy changed to meet the criteria of this indicator. Those patients already prescribed an unlicensed beta-blocker will be excluded. Patients with a current diagnosis of heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) who are currently treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of patients from the denominator who are additionally currently treated with a beta-blocker licensed for heart failure
This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period with a blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg OR patients with a blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg and prescribed 2 or more anti-hypertensive medications during the most recent office visit.Effective management of blood pressure in patients with coronary artery disease can help prevent cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction.  The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines.  Blood pressure control according to Joint National Conference VII guidelines is recommended (i.e., blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg or less than 130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease).  For hypertensive patients with well established coronary artery disease, it is useful to add blood pressure medication as tolerated, treating initially with beta-blockers (BBs) and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, with addition of other drugs as needed to achieve target blood pressure.  Treating systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to targets that are less than 140/90 mm Hg is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk complications. In patients with hypertension and diabetes or renal disease, the blood pressure goal is less than 130/80 mm Hg.  Unless contraindicated, pharmacologic therapy should be initiated with a BB.  If angina and blood pressure are not controlled by BB therapy alone, or if BBs are contraindicated, as in the presence of severe reactive airway disease, severe peripheral arterial disease, high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, or the sick-sinus syndrome, either long acting dihydropyridine or nondihydropyridine type calcium channel blockers (CCBs) may be used. All patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients with a blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg OR patients with a blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg and prescribed 2 or more anti-hypertensive medications during the most recent office visit (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
