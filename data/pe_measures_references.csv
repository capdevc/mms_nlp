15656708	Nearly 10% of CSHCN had experienced delayed or forgone health care in the past 12 months in 2001. Logistic regression showed that delayed or forgone care was more likely to be reported by the families of CSHCN who were adolescents, who had more severe limitations, lived in the South or West, lacked medical insurance, and who lived in families under or near the federal poverty line. Hispanics were more likely to report "lack of medical specialty" and "had language, communication, or cultural problems with provider." Both Hispanics and non-Hispanic others were twice as likely to report "provider not accessible" as reasons for the delayed or forgone care compared with non-Hispanic whites or blacks. conclusion: CSHCN with certain socioeconomic status and sociodemographic characteristics, as well as those with severe limitations in activity, were more likely to be affected by circumstances that result in delayed or forgone care.
9559090	The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of dental caries and the use of dental services in a pediatric population of Mexican-American migrant workers. The results were compared with the Mexican-American child population from the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). One hundred thirty three-to-sixteen-year-old children participated in the study. The children who were born in Mexico and those who spoke Spanish had seen the dentist less often and had a higher incidence of decayed teeth than those who were born in the US and than those who spoke English (p < 0.05). The children from low-income families had visited the dentist less frequently and did so at an older age than those from high income families (p < 0.05). When compared with HHANES, the children in this study visited the dentist at an older age, had been to the dentist less often, were less likely to have dental insurance, and had a higher incidence of dental caries than the children from HHANES (p > 0.05). This study demonstrated a general lack of dental health knowledge, a disproportionate prevalence of decayed teeth and unmet dental need in the Mexican-American migrant workers' children.
9586472	In this study, patient opinion on oral rehabilitation by means of Brnemark implants was investigated. All patients were referred to a periodontal clinic for implant installation and treated by one and the same operator. Prosthetic restorations were performed by dentists, who had no previous experience with prostheses on implants, but had completed a postgraduate training course. Patient opinion was obtained through questionnaires, pertaining to satisfaction and oral function. A comparison was made between pre-implant situation, short-term (< 4 months) and long-term functioning (3 years) with the implant-restorative rehabilitation. In total, 61 patients participated in the study; 23 received a full lower arch bridge and 18 a full upper arch bridge, while 20 patients got partial bridges. Of 298 installed implants, 7 failed at abutment connection (2.3%) and 1 during the 3-year follow-up interval (0.3%). The study results indicated that a great majority of patients were very satisfied with the treatment. Comfort with eating, aesthetics, phonetics and overall satisfaction improved significantly and nearly all patients said that they would undergo the treatment again or recommend it to others. Patients experienced their implants as "natural" teeth. The conclusion is that rehabilitation ad modum Brnemark, even in the hands of non-specialized dentists, can be of high quality, improving oral function and satisfying the needs and demands of patients.
8942125	To examine the prevalence of depressive symptoms and its relationship with quality-of-life domains in home-care cancer patients at an advanced stage of illness, 86 patients were given psychological tests for depression (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale) (HAD) and quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-C30) 1 week after admission to the home-care program. Using a proper cut-off score on the HAD-Depression subscale, depressive symptoms were reported by 45% of the patients. The quality of life of depressed patients was more affected than non-depressed patients in the social, emotional, cognitive, and physical domains. Significant correlations were found between depression scores and impairment in most quality-of-life areas. These findings support the importance of depression and quality-of-life evaluation in patients with advanced cancer who are followed in a home-care setting. This evaluation is needed to provide patients, their families, and caregivers with appropriate psychosocial interventions.
11219561	These findings highlight the importance of relationship quality in determining patients' loyalty to a physician's practice. They suggest that in the race to the bottom line medical practices and health plans cannot afford to ignore that the essence of medical care involves the interaction of one human being with another.
10461579	Benchmarking is generally considered to be an important tool for quality improvement. Traditional approaches to benchmarking have relied on subjective identification of 'leaders in the field'. We derive an objective, reproducible and attainable Achievable Benchmark of Care (ABC) by measuring and analysing performance on process-of-care indicators. Three characteristics of the ABC that we deem essential are: (1) benchmarks represent a measurable level of excellence; (2) benchmarks are demonstrably attainable; (3) benchmarks are derived from data in an objective, reproducible and predetermined fashion. From these characteristics it follows that (4) providers with high performance are selected to define a level of excellence in a predetermined fashion, but (5) providers with high performance on small numbers of cases do not influence unduly benchmark levels. We use the 'pared mean' to operationalize the ABC. Roughly, the pared mean summarizes the performance of top-ranked providers whereby at least 10% of the patient pool across all providers is included. Bayesian estimators for adjustment of performance of providers with small sample sizes are used to rank providers. Randomized controlled trials to assess the independent effect of the ABC in quality improvement projects are under way. We have developed a methodology objectively and reproducibly to derive a level of excellent, attainable performance, based on measured performance by a group of providers. The ABC can be applied to groups of providers in communities, to institutions and departments within them, or to individual practitioners.
18370895	The FATE survey offers an important source of quality data that can be used to improve the end-of-life care of all veterans, regardless of the type of care they receive or their site of death.
17680901	This study reveals that patient race is associated with the quality of patient-physician communication to a greater extent than BP control. Interventions that improve patient-physician communication should be tested as a strategy to reduce racial disparities in hypertension care and outcomes.
17606959	Incapacitated patients without surrogates accounted for approximately 1 in 20 deaths in intensive care units. Most life-support decisions were made by physicians without institutional or judicial review.
10815125	The observed racial/ethnic differences in CAHPS ratings and reports of care are more a result of different experiences with care for people enrolled in the same plans than a result of racial/ethnic minorities being enrolled in plans with worse experiences. Health care organizations should engage in quality improvement activities to address the observed racial/ethnic disparities in assessments of care.
10069149	Considerable research has addressed quality of life and quality of care; however, it has not addressed adequately the experiences of patients and their families at the end of life. Health care may have a greater effect on quality of life during the dying process than it normally does. Building on research and expert review, a conceptual framework is presented that specifies and integrates quality of life and quality of health care indicators. Five main concepts include patient/family context, structure of care, process of care, satisfaction with care, and quality and length of life. Patient and family perspectives are considered. The framework emphasizes quality of life, thus detailed definitions of each quality of life domain are provided. The goal is to facilitate development of a comprehensive set of measures to describe the quality of life of dying persons and evaluate the care they receive, to be used to improve end-of-life care.
15880974	This study evaluates the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care measure (P3C) in an underserved population: children of Latino farm workers. Bilingual research assistants verbally administered the P3C, as well as a measure of child health-related quality of life (HRQL: the PedsQL 4.0) and demographic questions to 297 Latino farm worker parents of young children, in San Diego and Imperial Counties. The P3C was found to be feasible, as measured by a very low percent of missing/do not know values. Internal consistency reliability for the Total Scale and most subscales was strong. The P3C's validity was demonstrated through factor analysis of the subscales, by showing that scores were lower for children without a regular physician and for children experiencing foregone health care, and by demonstrating that P3C scores were related to HRQL. The P3C can be useful to various stakeholders in measuring primary care for vulnerable populations.
15746592	NHQR and NHDR provide essential information on children's health care quality. Future reports can be improved by including child-relevant perspectives in priority-setting and data-gathering efforts.
12540939	Initial experience with this novel system has confirmed safety, patient satisfaction and surgeon satisfaction.
11433796	Hispanics in Medicare managed care face barriers to care; however, their experiences with care vary by language and region. Spanish speakers (except FL) have less favorable experiences with provider communication and office staff helpfulness than their English-speaking counterparts, suggesting language barriers in the clinical encounter. On the other hand, Spanish speakers reported more favorable experiences than their English-speaking counterparts with the managed care aspects of their care (getting needed care and plan customer service). Medicare managed care plans need to address the observed disparities in patient experiences among Hispanics as part of their quality improvement efforts. Plans can work with their network providers to address issues related to timeliness of care and office staff helpfulness. In addition, plans can provide incentives for language services, which have the potential to improve communication with providers and staff among Spanish speakers. Finally, health plans can reduce the access barriers faced by Hispanics, especially among English speakers.
11083669	Differences were evident in technologic and pharmacologic support and in physician prescribing habits in patients for whom life support was or was not withheld or withdrawn. Substantial variability was noted in physician documentation of physician-family interactions surrounding the withdrawal of life support.
7807659	Research on quality of care for children has lagged behind its counterpart for adults. Defining key issues and questions in seven topic areas-the health of children; the efficacy and effectiveness of health services for children; assessing quality of care; improving quality of care within health services delivery systems; assessing and improving quality at the community level; getting financial incentives right; and disseminating information about the results of research investigations-will facilitate the development of an effective research strategy. Ultimately, enhanced information in these areas will lead to improvements in the processes and outcomes of care for children.
12846852	Changes have been moderate in the perceived oral health in this cohort, despite the rather drastic changes in the remuneration of dental care during this study time. On the other hand, this also means that the social differences remain, despite the official goals of increased equity.
8840076	Utilization of various types of services for children's mental health problems was examined among 112 agricultural farm worker families. Pairs of mothers and children (aged 8 to 11) were interviewed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children and the Child and Adolescent Services Assessment. Sixty-four percent of the children met criterion for one or more psychiatric diagnoses. Children with a psychiatric diagnosis were five times more likely to see a health professional for a mental health problem compared to children without a psychiatric diagnosis However, less than half of the children with a psychiatric diagnosis saw a health professional for their mental health problems. Families also consulted with school professionals, religious leaders, and non-professionals (such as friends) concerning their children's mental health, but families of children who had a psychiatric diagnosis were not significantly more likely to report these types of consultations than were families of children who did not have a psychiatric diagnosis. These findings are discussed in terms of recommendations for improving the mental health service delivery system for rural children.
17197788	The shortened FS-ICU measures two main conceptual domains-satisfaction with care and satisfaction with decision making. Scores on the FS-ICU show good validity against other indicators of ICU quality. The instrument holds promise as a useful outcome measure in studies that attempt to improve this component of ICU care.
7790978	Both physician and patient preferences for CPR influence total hospital resource consumption. Physician misunderstanding of patient preferences to forego CPR was associated with increased use of hospital resources, and could have led to a course of care at odds with patients' expressed preferences in the event of cardiac arrest. Increasing physicians' knowledge of patient preferences, and increasing communication to help patients understand that options for medical care that include foregoing resuscitation efforts, might reduce hospital expenditures for the seriously ill.
11075528	Although preliminary evidence shows that people generally prefer to die at home, very little is known about where Canadians die. Understanding the epidemiology of dying in Canada may illuminate opportunities to improve quality of end-of-life care and related health policy. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of death records in Canada to determine the proportions of deaths occurring in hospitals and special care units. Our analysis found that deaths in Canada occur in hospitals with provincial and territorial proportions ranging from 87% in Quebec to 52% in the Northwest Territories. In hospitals recording deaths in special care units, 18.64% of all deaths occurred in special care units. The proportion of deaths in special care units ranged from 25% in Manitoba to 7% in the Northwest Territories. The proportion of deaths in special care units varied by size and nature (teaching vs. non-teaching) of hospitals. It increased with the size of the hospital from 8% in hospitals with 1-49 beds, to 23% for hospitals with 400 or more beds. In teaching hospitals, 27% of deaths occurred in special care units, and in non-teaching hospitals the proportion was 15%. In conclusion, the majority of deaths in Canada occur in hospitals and a substantial proportion occur in special care units, raising questions about the appropriateness and quality of current end-of-life care practices in Canada.
12387641	Latinos recently became the largest racial/ethnic minority group of US children. The Latino Consortium of the American Academy of Pediatrics Center for Child Health Research, consisting of 13 expert panelists, identified the most important urgent priorities and unanswered questions in Latino child health. Conclusions were drawn when consensus was reached among members, with refinement through multiple iterations. A consensus statement with supporting references was drafted and revised. This article summarizes the key issues, including lack of validated research instruments, frequent unjustified exclusion from studies, and failure to analyze data by pertinent subgroups. Latino children are at high risk for behavioral and developmental disorders, and there are many unanswered questions about their mental health needs and use of services. The prevalence of dental caries is disproportionately higher for Latino children, but the reasons for this disparity are unclear. Culture and language can profoundly affect Latino children's health, but not enough cultural competency training of health care professionals and provision of linguistically appropriate care occur. Latinos are underrepresented at every level of the health care professions. Latino children are at high risk for school dropout, environmental hazards, obesity, diabetes mellitus, asthma, lack of health insurance, nonfinancial barriers to health care access, and impaired quality of care, but many key questions in these areas remain unanswered. This article suggests areas in which more research is needed and ways to improve research and care of Latino children.
14976909	Although customer loyalty is frequently cited as a benefit of patient satisfaction, an empirical link between the two has not, to our knowledge, ever been statistically established in a hospital setting. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between self-reported patient satisfaction measures and subsequent return to the provider for care at a large academic medical center. Data from all adult medical patients responding to a patient satisfaction survey distributed by a large midwestern academic medical center during fiscal year 1997 (n = 1485) were analyzed. Response patterns were examined as they related to whether patients returned to the provider during the subsequent 2-year period. Analyses suggested that return-to-provider was associated with only a minority of the satisfaction items (approx. 11%). All items showing a significant relationship measured perceptions of how well physicians and nurses attended to, and provided information to, patients and their families. Although the size of these relationships was generally small, the estimated financial implications are substantial. Other implications of these findings for planning effective service improvement initiatives as well as improving patient survey design are discussed.
18977978	For vulnerable children with asthma, barriers to care explain variance in primary care characteristics beyond that explained by access, demographic factors, and disease severity.
9714637	A substantial minority of US children were identified as having an existing special health care need using national survey data. Children with existing special health care needs are disproportionately poor and socially disadvantaged. Moreover, many of these children face significant barriers to health care.
16169788	Children with Medicaid insurance are less likely to attend scheduled visits for subspecialty asthma care, controlling for seasonal variation. Programs designed to address disparities in pediatric asthma outcomes regarding subspecialist care may improve their effectiveness by addressing barriers to attendance and anticipating poor attendance in the fall season.
10450723	African Americans and Latinos use services that require a doctor's order at lower rates than do whites. Racial bias and patient preferences contribute to disparities, but their effects appear small. Communication during the medical interaction plays a central role in decision making about subsequent interventions and health behaviors. Research has shown that doctors have poorer communication with minority patients than with others, but problems in doctor-patient communication have received little attention as a potential cause, a remediable one, of health disparities. We evaluate the evidence that poor communication is a cause of disparities and propose some remedies drawn from the communication sciences.
8215753	Residents and nurses caring for patients newly admitted to the ICU agree in their assessment of cognition, judgment, and capacity to participate in medical decision making, and are not unduly influenced by ventilator status. Their assessments correlate highly with abbreviated formal mental status testing.
20605850	The purpose of this study was to further validate a novel instrument to measure satisfaction with end-of-life care, called the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire. Data were collected by a cross-sectional survey of patients who had advanced, life-limiting illnesses and their family caregivers, and who completed CANHELP, a global rating of satisfaction, and a quality of life questionnaire. We conducted factor analysis, assessed internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha, and evaluated construct validity by describing the correlation amongst CANHELP, global rating of satisfaction and the quality of life questionnaire scores. There were 361 patient and 193 family questionnaires available for analysis. In the factor analysis, we identified six easily interpretable factors which explained 55.4% and 60.2% of the variance for the patient and caregiver questionnaire, respectively. For the patient version, the subscales derived from these factors were Relationship with Doctors, Illness Management, Communication, Decision-Making, Role of the Family, and Your Well-being. For the family questionnaire, the factors were Relationship with Doctors, Characteristics of Doctors and Nurses, Illness Management, Communication and Decision-Making, Your Involvement, and Your Well-being. Each subscale for each questionnaire had acceptable to excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.69-0.94). We observed good correlations between the CANHELP overall satisfaction score and global rating of satisfaction (correlation coefficient 0.49 and 0.63 for patient and family, respectively) which was greater than the correlations between CANHELP and the quality of life instruments. We conclude that the CANHELP Questionnaire is a valid and internally consistent instrument to measure satisfaction with end-of-life care.
20179265	Higher patient satisfaction is associated with improved guideline adherence and lower inpatient mortality rates, suggesting that patients are good discriminators of the type of care they receive. Thus, patients' satisfaction with their care provides important incremental information on the quality of acute myocardial infarction care.
16956704	The paper reviews the existing research related to asthma disparities and frames the results of this research within a conceptual model modified from the Institute of Medicine model in order to explain asthma health disparities in Latino children in the USA. The model of pediatric asthma disparity presented is based on the conceptualization of health disparities as the result of a complex interaction of factors related to four main domains: the individual and family, the environment or context in which the child lives, the health-care system, and provider characteristics. Asthma disparities are discussed as they are reflected in the process of care (access and quality of treatment) and outcome (prevalence, morbidity, severity) experienced by Latino children. The potential mechanisms that may account for the asthma disparities documented as reflected by the conceptual model proposed are discussed. Finally, several suggestions for future research examining determinants that account for asthma disparities are examined.
6592350	A considerable number of Hispanic agricultural workers come to Northwest Michigan during the summer every year to harvest fruit and vegetable crops. The Department of Community Dentistry of The University of Michigan School of Dentistry helps provide dental services for these migrant workers and their families. Some 203 five-to-14-year-old children of migrant farm workers were examined for caries and periodontal condition and the results compared with recent national surveys. Traditional indicators of dental caries experience (DMFT/dft and DMFS/dfs indices), periodontal disease (PI), and oral cleanliness (OHI-S) were used by one examiner. These migrant children presented higher numbers of decayed teeth and lower numbers of restored teeth than United States schoolchildren generally. Migrant children also presented less caries-free teeth and higher PI and OHI-S scores than United States children generally.
19535929	Opinions of relatives should be taken into account when designing ICU information booklets. Relatives want more information than that anticipated by physicians or suggested in guidelines, but the youngest or the less-educated ones may respond less favorably to written information.
11468499	Financial, potential, and realized access to care are associated prospectively with the full range of primary care experiences--comprehensiveness, communication, coordination, and contextual knowledge--beyond continuity and accessibility. Access to a regular source of care and to needed care are each associated with larger effects on primary care experiences than is the presence of health insurance. Gaining insurance or a regular source of care results in primary care experiences similar to always having had these, while losing a regular source of care has a more immediate effect than losing insurance on primary care experiences.
10183283	This article discusses the concepts and approaches underlying managed behavioral health care and the need to assess quality of care. The author describes the Performance Measures for Managed Behavioral Healthcare Programs (PERMS) developed by the American Managed Behavioral Healthcare Association (AMBHA), which is offered as a first step toward enhanced quality of care assessment in managed behavioral health care.
10183287	This article reports on the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) national report card to examine quality of care under managed care. The national report card will provide a summary of state policies underpinning the move of managed care into the public mental health system, and directly probe consumer and family member perceptions and experiences of managed care and the policies and practices of managed care organizations.
2294444	Hospitalization accounts for a large portion of the expenditures for child health care, and differences in the rate of hospitalization may produce important variations in the cost of that care. We studied the rates of hospitalization in Boston, Rochester (N.Y.), and New Haven (Conn.) in 1982. We assigned the risk of hospitalization in Rochester a score of 1.00. Boston children were hospitalized at more than twice the rate of Rochester children for most medical diagnostic categories (relative risk, 2.65; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.53 to 2.78), and the rate for the New Haven group was intermediate (relative risk, 1.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.68 to 1.93). Rates of inpatient surgery differed less (Boston relative risk, 1.12; New Haven relative risk, 0.93). The relative risks of hospitalization (as compared with Rochester children) for Boston and New Haven children, respectively, were 3.8 and 2.3 for asthma, 6.1 and 2.9 for toxic ingestions, and 2.6 and 2.7 for head injuries. Fractures of the femur, appendicitis, and bacterial meningitis (conditions uniformly treated in the hospital) had similar rates of hospitalization across the three cities, but the relative risk of hospitalization for aseptic meningitis was 3.7 in Boston. The rates of hospitalization of children in all three communities were below the national averages in 1982. Although this study does not define the reasons for the variation in rates of hospitalization, it is possible that they were related in part to differences in socioeconomic status or access to primary care. The implications of these data for the cost and quality of pediatric care therefore remain to be determined.
9031575	These findings suggest the need for a larger, epidemiological study of the psychiatric morbidity of rural children of farm workers.
19188420	The validity of the survey was supported in mail and Internet modes for the American English language, and the instrument was approved by the CAHPS consortium for distribution as the CAHPS Dental Plan Survey. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS. A tool is available now for assessing dental care quality by measuring adult patients' experiences with their dental care and coverage. The authors tested this instrument only in a population with third-party coverage, however, which is a potential limitation that should be considered.
18053680	To identify aspects of end-of-life care in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system that are not assessed by existing survey instruments and to identify issues that may be unique to veterans, telephone interviews using open-ended questions were conducted with family members of veterans who had received care from a VA facility in the last month of life. Responses were compared to validated end-of-life care assessment instruments in common use. The study took place in four VA medical centers and one family member per patient was invited to participate, selected from medical records using predefined eligibility criteria. These family members were asked to describe positive and negative aspects of the care the veteran received in the last month of life. Interview questions elicited perceptions of care both at VA sites and at non-VA sites. Family reports were coded and compared with items in five existing prospective and retrospective instruments that assess the quality of care that patients receive near the end of life. Interviews were completed with 66 family members and revealed 384 codes describing both positive and negative aspects of care during the last month of life. Almost half of these codes were not represented in any of the five reference instruments (n=174; 45%). These codes, some of which are unique to the veteran population, were grouped into eight categories: information about VA benefits (n=36; 55%), inpatient care (n=36; 55%), access to care (n=33; 50%), transitions in care (n=32; 48%), care that the veteran received at the time of death (n=31; 47%), home care (n=26; 40%), health care facilities (n=12; 18%), and mistakes and complications (n=18; 27%). Although most of the reference instruments assessed some aspect of these categories, they did not fully capture the experiences described by our respondents. These data suggest that many aspects of veterans' end-of-life care that are important to their families are not assessed by existing survey instruments. VA efforts to evaluate end-of-life care for veterans should not only measure common aspects of care (e.g., pain management), but also examine performance in areas that are more specific to the veteran population.
9811291	Parents identified language problems, cultural differences, poverty, lack of health insurance, transportation difficulties, and long waiting times as the major access barriers to health care for Latino children. Language problems can result in adverse health consequences for some children, including poor medical care, misdiagnosis, and inappropriate medication and hospitalization. Low family income is an important independent risk factor among Latino children for suboptimal health and high utilization of health services.
10227311	These domains, which characterize patients' perspectives on end-of-life care, can serve as focal points for improving the quality of end-of-life care.
16336491	The TSQM v. II has equivalent measurement characteristics as the TSQM v. I, yet uses four fewer items and more consistent wording. The value of the Decisional Balance Model for estimation of dosing adherence and medication persistence over time is discussed.
9634265	Daily pain is prevalent among nursing home residents with cancer and is often untreated, particularly among older and minority patients.
15265756	Specific communication practices of multiple professionals in health care settings can impact patient outcomes. This study, conducted at a large Children's Hospital, sought to determine the extent to which patient-centered communication (PCC) affected satisfaction with communication and with care itself. Parents of child patients (N = 195) reported on the communication practices of physicians, nurses, and hospital staff members during their most recent stay in the hospital. Surveys were completed on site. Health care providers' use of PCC behaviors, especially immediacy and perceived listening, was positively associated with satisfaction with care and with communication. In addition, PCC behaviors were perceived to be used more frequently with children in better health than with children with poorer health status.
19093939	Palliative consultations improve outcomes of care, and earlier consultations may confer additional benefit.
3858344	Unlike previous studies that examined specialized populations or were completed some years ago, this survey collected information from a cross-section of patients who were currently receiving various kinds of dental treatment. Although the study disclosed that patients' preferences and perceptions of dentists' performance might vary within and between demographic groups, a more important finding was that, in general, most patients in all demographic groups held common beliefs about how they would like to be treated by their dentists. However, according to the reports of these patients, the dentists did not always behave in ways that were congruent with the patients' preferences. The study showed that patients are sensitive to dentists' behaviors. It should also be noted that dentists are sensitive to patients' behaviors and that dentist-patient relationships may be a source of stress for both patients and dentists. Nevertheless, the responsibility for setting the tone of these relationships rests primarily with the dentist rather than with the patient. Therefore, it is important for dentists to be aware of the needs and preferences of their patients so that they can act in ways that will make patients comfortable and dental treatment a positive experience. The potential that appears to be inherent in good, satisfying dentist-patient relationships for minimizing patient stress and making dentistry a less stressful profession has yet to be fully realized. Dentistry is a two-way street: whatever benefits the patient should in turn benefit the dentist as well.
10649587	The audit-based proxy measures represent a complex but feasible approach to the calculation of performance measures for those programs lacking robust administrative data systems. However, until charts contain more complete diagnostic information (i.e., periodontal charting and diagnostic codes or reason-for-treatment codes), accurate determination of these aspects of clinical performance will be difficult.
17992508	European ICU physicians do not experience difficulties with end-of-life decisions in most cases. Allocation of limited resources is a minor consideration and autonomous choices by patient or family remain unusual. Inter-regional differences were found.
11331691	The PHDS provides a comprehensive, psychometrically valid and reliable assessment of how well health plans and the health care providers working within these plans promote the healthy development of young children. The PHDS seems to differentiate among health care plans and among the different aspects of preventive care provided within a health plan. For the population studied here, there is significant room for improvement in ensuring families and children receive appropriate and family-centered care to promote the healthy development of children between 3 and 48 months old. Because the PHDS is conceptually based on national recommendations for child health supervision, improved performance on the PHDS would indicate greater adherence to these national recommendations and progress toward the achievement of Healthy People 2010 goals. The generalizability of the findings presented in this report are being examined using data collected in 5 statewide Medicaid samples (N = 11 696) and data from the National Survey of Early Childhood Health, which has incorporated most of the PHDS items.
16964898	JCAHO says communication problems were the leading root cause of sentinel events in 2005. The reasons are manifold: a harried environment, a hierarchical staffing system and illegible handwriting, to name a few. This gatefold examines the scope of the problem, including data and risk factors, and offers some strategies for improvement.
17674601	Effective communication between patients and health care providers is a critical element to quality health care. Becoming aware of patients' attitudes, beliefs, biases, and behaviors that may influence patient care can help clinicians improve access to and quality of care. Health care providers should develop a strategic plan for improvement, then implement and evaluate the plan to include structured, continuously improving progress toward achieving cultural competency goals. In this challenging health care environment, health care providers need the skills to explore the meaning of illness, to determine patient's social and family context, and provide patient-centered and culturally competent care.
15248886	The patients in the present study were highly satisfied with the outcome of the treatment and experienced it to be without significant unpleasantness irrespective of the treatment concept.
9471938	Among seriously ill hospitalized adults, communication about preferences for cardiopulmonary resuscitation is uncommon. A majority of patients who have not discussed preferences for end-of-life care do not want to do so. For patients who do not want to discuss their preferences, as well as patients with an unmet need for such discussions, failure to discuss preferences for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and mechanical ventilation may result in unwanted interventions.
2235219	To evaluate access to health care for American children and adolescents, a telephone survey of a national random sample of households was conducted in which 2182 children 17 years or younger were studied. Approximately 10% had no medical insurance; 10% had no regular source of care; and 18% identified emergency rooms, community clinics, or hospital outpatient departments as their usual site of medical care. Children who were uninsured, poor, or nonwhite were less likely to have seen a physician in the past year (P less than .001), and uninsured children were less likely to have up-to-date immunizations. Logistic regression analyses revealed that poor, uninsured, or nonwhite children less frequently had a regular source of care; more frequently used emergency rooms, community clinics, and hospital outpatient departments as their regular providers; and more frequently encountered financial barriers to health care. Low-income or nonwhite children had much less access to care compared with children from more affluent or white families, independent of insurance status or health status.
16334968	Understanding patients' and family members' perspectives on the relative importance of elements of end-of-life (EOL) care and their satisfaction with those elements will help prioritize quality improvement initiatives. We administered a face-to-face questionnaire containing a selection of 28 elements of care to eligible inpatients with advanced lung, heart, or liver disease, or metastatic cancer, and available family caregivers (FCGs) in five tertiary care hospitals across Canada. 440 of 569 (78%) eligible patients and 160 of 176 (91%) FCGs participated. No respondent reported complete satisfaction with all elements of care. The average satisfaction score was 4.6 on a 26 point scale. Medical patients reported lower levels of satisfaction than cancer patients. Elements rated as "extremely important" and anything other than "completely satisfied" most frequently by respondents related to discharge planning, availability of home health services, symptom relief, not being a burden, physician trust, and communication. In conclusion, most patients and their family members in our survey were not completely satisfied with EOL care. Improvement initiatives to target key elements identified by patients and FCGs have the potential to improve satisfaction with EOL care across care settings.
7730685	This article represents the contributions of the panel on "Neuropsychiatric Syndromes and Psychological Symptoms" of the National Cancer Institute of Canada Workshop on Symptom Control and Supportive Care in Patients with Advanced Cancer. The panel's presentations focused on mood disorders and cognitive disorders, and described the current state of knowledge regarding prevalence, assessment, and intervention. Recommendations for future research are presented based on a consensus of the panel as to the need to fill glaring gaps in our current state of knowledge, and a desire to improve the quality of research in this area of palliative medicine. Recommendations for future research on neuropsychiatric symptoms and syndromes in palliative care include (1) adoption of uniform terminology (taxonomy of disorders) and diagnostic classification systems, (2) utilization of existing validated tools and measures in prevalence and intervention research, (3) development of new tools and measures that are more applicable and relevant to the palliative care setting, (4) encouragement for studies of the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms and syndromes, (5) promotion of intervention studies utilizing pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for depressive disorders and cognitive disorders in advanced cancer patients, and (6) expansion of the focus of such research to other neuropsychiatric disorders (for example, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorders, and sleep disorders), symptoms (fatigue and tension) and related issues (suicidal ideation and desire for hastened death).
7999421	The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) is a new patient-rated instrument that was developed to provide multidimensional information about a diverse group of common symptoms. This study evaluated the reliability and validity of the MSAS in the cancer population. Randomly selected inpatients and outpatients (n = 246) with prostate, colon, breast or ovarian cancer were assessed using the MSAS and a battery of measures that independently evaluate phenomena related to quality of life. Symptom prevalence in the 218 evaluable patients ranged from 73.9% for lack of energy to 10.6% for difficulty swallowing. Based on a content analysis, three symptoms were deleted and two were added; the revised scale evaluates 32 physical and psychological symptoms. A factor analysis of variance yielded two factors that distinguished three major symptom groups and several subgroups. The major groups comprised psychological symptoms (PSYCH), high prevalence physical symptoms (PHYS H), and low prevalence physical symptoms (PHYS L). Internal consistency was high in the PHYS H and PSYCH groups (Cronback alpha coefficients of 0.88 and 0.83, respectively), and moderate in the PHYS L group (alpha = 0.58). Although the severity, frequency and distress dimensions were highly intercorrelated, canonical correlations and other analyses demonstrated that multidimensional assessment (frequency and distress) augments information about the impact of symptoms. High correlations with clinical status and quality of life measures support the validity of the MSAS and indicate the utility of several subscale scores, including PSYCH, PHYS, and a brief Global Distress Index. The MSAS is a reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of symptom prevalence, characteristics and distress. It provides a method for comprehensive symptom assessment that may be useful when information about symptoms is desirable, such as clinical trials that incorporate quality of life measures or studies of symptom epidemiology.
9895002	We established the feasibility of operationalizing a noncategorical conceptual definition by using a large-scale data set and provided an estimate of the prevalence of chronic conditions among US children. We confirmed that several sociodemographic correlates of chronic conditions in samples identified through diagnostic checklists were related to the presence of chronic conditions among these children.
22092877	In 2008, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) launched the Five-Star Quality Rating System to help consumers compare nursing homes. The quality rating system consists of three domains: nursing home inspection results, staffing, and quality measures (QMs) and an overall rating calculated from the three domains. The Five-Star System has both advocates and detractors. One source of criticism about the rating system is its lack of input from consumer surveys. Although different dimensions of quality have been recognized as important by the experts and studied in the literature, how these dimensions are linked with each other is largely unknown. This article describes an analysis of the relationship between overall experience of care ratings from a family survey and ratings obtained on the CMS Five-Star Quality Rating for Maryland nursing homes. The results indicated a strong positive correlation between family experience of care score and two five-star domains, namely health inspections and nurse staffing, and no relationship with the quality domain. The lack of relationship between the quality domain and the family score may be due to inadequate risk adjustment or that each rating system measures different aspects of quality.
9178792	The characteristics of childhood as a unique developmental stage of life, the continuity of child health with adult health, and a distinctive child health care system justify a separate focus of health services research on children. Child health services research (CHSR) currently lacks the tools necessary to monitor the impact of health system change on children's health and health care and to compare the effectiveness of alternative treatment modalities. There is an urgent need to build the research capacity of this field of inquiry. Ignoring or minimizing attention to CHSR is both shortsighted and ultimately costly for families and the entire nation. We present arguments for why children merit a separate focus in health services research, identify factors that have led to the failure of appropriate development of CHSR, and offer a set of strategies for how to build the research capacity of the field.
17996835	Clinicians should be aware of important barriers to care that may exist for immigrant families who are poor, uninsured, and non-English speakers. Reduced health care access and utilization by children with asthma in immigrant families requires policy attention. Further research should examine barriers to care as well as parental perceptions of health for children with asthma in immigrant families.
15894705	Twenty-one million Americans are limited in English proficiency (LEP), but little is known about the effect of medical interpreter services on health care quality. Asystematic literature review was conducted on the impact of interpreter services on quality of care. Five database searches yielded 2,640 citations and a final database of 36 articles, after applying exclusion criteria. Multiple studies document that quality of care is compromised when LEP patients need but do not get interpreters. LEP patients' quality of care is inferior, and more interpreter errors occur with untrained ad hoc interpreters. Inadequate interpreter services can have serious consequences for patients with mental disorders. Trained professional interpreters and bilingual health care providers positively affect LEP patients' satisfaction, quality of care, and outcomes. Evidence suggests that optimal communication, patient satisfaction, and outcomes and the fewest interpreter errors occur when LEP patients have access to trained professional interpreters or bilingual providers.
11441624	Patients with advanced lung cancer suffer frequent and severe symptoms that worsen in the final months of life. The appropriate timing and combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy are yet to be resolved. Future studies will require use of validated quality of life instruments to better catalogue palliation and treatment toxicity.
10916961	This study suggests that racial and ethnic minorities and persons with limited English proficiency face barriers to care, despite Medicaid-enabled financial access. Health care organizations should address the observed disparities in access to care for racial/ethnic and linguistic minorities as part of their quality improvement efforts.
8482768	Patients reported little or no pain during or after treatment with a dental laser. With many people reporting fear of pain as their chief reason for not seeking dental care, lasers may offer a more acceptable treatment technique.
15686076	Parents and professional caregivers, although united in their shared goal of returning a sick child to health, do not always view the caregiving situation from the same frame of reference. This article describes the perspectives of more than 50,000 parents whose child experienced a hospitalization. It outlines the greatest opportunities for improving the pediatric inpatient experience from the parent's perspective. In addition, practical tips and strategies for planning improvements in care from the patient/family perspective are offered.
8703185	Major ethnic groups and subgroups of children differ strikingly in demographics, health, and use of services; subgroup differences are easily overlooked; and most disparities persist even after adjustment for family income and parental education.
9100724	In these seriously ill patients, ADs did not substantially enhance physician-patient communication or decision-making about resuscitation. This lack of effect was not altered by the PSDA or by the enhanced efforts in SUPPORT, although these interventions each substantially increased documentation of existing ADs. Current practice patterns indicate that increasing the frequency of ADs is unlikely to be a substantial element in improving the care of seriously ill patients. Future work to improve decision-making should focus upon improving the current pattern of practice through better communication and more comprehensive advance care planning.
9100724	Advance directives placed in the medical records of seriously ill patients often did not guide medical decision-making beyond naming a healthcare proxy or documenting general preferences in a standard living will format. Even when specific instructions were present, care was potentially inconsistent in half of the cases.
8629645	The diagnosis, patients' perception of the prognosis, and hospital site were significantly associated with patients' resuscitation preferences after adjusting for patient demographics, severity of illness, and functional status. The rate of discussing CPR was low even for patients who did not want CPR. Patient preferences not to receive CPR were associated with a small decrease in intensity of care but no difference in hospital survival.
11293838	Surveys such as the CABHS can identify aspects of the plan and treatment that are improvement priorities. Use of these data is likely to extend beyond the behavioral health plan to consumers, purchasers, regulators, and policymakers, particularly because the National Committee for Quality Assurance is encouraging behavioral health plans to use a similar survey for accreditation purposes.
14653278	It has been suggested that patients should accept the use of the air abrasion technique over the conventional handpiece due to the reduced need for anesthesia. Technologies for both air abrasion and the conventional rotary handpiece have, in recent decades, seen major improvements, but there are no recent scientific publications that evaluate the patient's preference for these two technologies when performing a cavity preparation. This study determined the patient's preference for air abrasion or the rotary handpiece for removing occlusal fissure carious lesions in mandibular premolars. Ten healthy subjects 18 years of age or older were recruited from the General Dentistry Clinic of the University of Rochester Eastman Dental Center, with fissure caries at a DEJ depth of similar size (determined by radiographs and clinical examination) in any two mandibular premolars in opposite quadrants. Within each subject, the two methods of caries removal were randomly assigned. In one premolar, air abrasion was used for cavity preparation, and in the other premolar, a conventional rotary handpiece was used. At each visit prior to treatment, the patients were instructed to complete the Emotional Status (ES) questionnaire (SUNY University at Buffalo Craniofacial Pain Clinic) to assess differences in their emotional status between appointments. At each appointment, when the restorative treatment was completed, patients were instructed to rate their pain on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A technique preference questionnaire was given after the second appointment. The subjects rated the perception of pain as significantly lower (p < 0.05) when using air abrasion (6.0 mm versus 29.6 mm). All of the patients preferred air abrasion over conventional rotary handpieces. None of the patients required anesthesia and there was no indication that the emotional status influenced the result. Air abrasion was the preferred method of cavity preparation when removing fissural caries in mandibular premolars and most subjects did not experience any pain when air abrasion was used.
14529039	This study examined the satisfaction of family members with the end-of-life care their loved ones received. Data were collected from 1,839 individuals receiving care from 17 different care agencies nationwide. Although family satisfaction with hospice care was generally quite high. situational factors played a role. The timing of the referral was critical, with families rating services lower almost across the board when the referral to hospice was deemed "too late." Additionally, families expressed greater satisfaction when the patient's care was overseen by the hospice director, rather than a personal physician. Each of these findings has important implications for physicians, patients, and families as they begin to plan for end-of-life care.
11532587	A fundamental barrier to improving the quality of medical care at the end of life is the lack of measurement tools. The Toolkit of Instruments to Measure End of Life Care (TIME) aims to fill that void by creating measurement tools that capture the patient and family perspective. To develop a conceptual model for a retrospective survey of bereaved family members that incorporates both professional and family perspectives on what constitutes good care at the end of life, a qualitative literature review of existing professional guidelines and six focus groups with bereaved family members from acute care hospitals (n = 2), nursing homes (n = 2), and hospice/VNA home health services (n = 2) was performed. The focus groups were held in Arizona, New York, and Massachusetts and included 42 bereaved family members/friends contacted 3-12 months from the time of patient's death. Domains of care that define quality end-of-life care were defined. Focus group participants defined high quality medical care as: 1) providing dying persons with desired physical comfort; 2) helping dying persons control decisions about medical care and daily routines; 3) relieving family members of the burden of being present at all times to advocate for their loved one; 4) educating family members so they felt confident to care for their loved ones at home; and 5) providing family members with emotional support both before and after the patient's death. The qualitative literature review yielded similar results, except that the professional guidelines did not mention the advocacy burden felt by families. These two sources provided the foundation for a conceptual model of patient-focused, family-centered medical care and a new tool for surveying bereaved family members. Views of bereaved family members' stories and professional guidelines help to identify key domains of quality of end-of-life care. A new survey instrument provides a way to incorporate the perspectives of bereaved family members in measuring the quality of end-of-life care.
3162273	Sixty-nine male patients participated in a self-evaluation survey measuring their satisfaction with maxillary and mandibular dentures. Patients generally had a high evaluation of their dentures, with the highest scores given to appearance. Age was not a significant predictor of denture success. Patients receiving their first dentures consistently had more difficulties in all categories of function, comfort, and appearance than patients with past experience with dentures.
11074777	Although pain and symptom management, communication with one's physician, preparation for death, and the opportunity to achieve a sense of completion are important to most, other factors important to quality at the end of life differ by role and by individual. Efforts to evaluate and improve patients' and families' experiences at the end of life must account for diverse perceptions of quality. JAMA. 2000;284:2476-2482.
17566011	Earlier discussions about treatment failure and end-of-life care, and the need for palliation, appear to be central to improving the quality of end-of-life care for patients dying on our medical teaching unit. Our results are consistent with other studies in this area.
20887572	Perceptions of past racism and classism in healthcare settings may negatively impact the affective tone of subsequent patient-provider communication.
12682650	This exploratory study's findings suggest that dental patients have distinct preferences in relation to treatment decision-making role and that these may not always be met during consultations with their dentist. The Control Preferences Scale appears to be appropriate for use in dental settings.
11118234	The rapid pace of change in the health care system presents tremendous challenges for clinicians and managers charged with the delivery of mental health and substance abuse services. Declining reimbursement, new incentive structures, and increasing competition are placing unprecedented pressure on providers to deliver care efficiently. Regulatory scrutiny, consumer dissatisfaction, and a growing awareness of gaps between actual and ideal practice have led to intensifying pressure to improve quality. Yet system change has also presented new opportunities for managing cost and quality of care. Consolidation of facilities and practices into integrated networks, developments in information systems technology, and the emergence of models to facilitate change have led to the rise of "quality management," a framework for assessing and improving clinical, operational, and financial performance within a health care organization. This article reviews some of the precipitating factors and theoretical structures underlying quality management and then, through a case study of one organization's experience, describes the implementation of a quality management program in a behavioral health care delivery system. The case study emphasizes how theoretical frameworks were operationalized and how organizational structure and process were shaped to address challenges well known in quality management, such as authority, accountability, and follow-through. A multiphase model of quality management program development is formulated and used to provide context for this program's development.
11409676	It was concluded that sensitivity to change of the OHIP was good. This property was not improved by using statement weights.
11219473	The TSQM is a psychometrically sound and valid measure of the major dimensions of patients' satisfaction with medication. Preliminary evidence suggests that the TSQM may also be a good predictor of patients' medication adherence across different types of medication and patient populations.
7537317	This study was designed to characterize unmet analgesic needs in a group of cancer patients. One hundred one inpatients were surveyed to document pain prevalence and intensity, satisfaction with pain control and factors associated with unmet analgesic needs during the week prior to admission. Forty-four percent had unmet analgesic needs, defined as pain of moderate or greater than moderate intensity. These patients had a significantly greater prevalence of bone and axillary node involvement, higher than pain intensity, and less satisfaction with pain control. Fifty-nine percent were satisfied with pain control. Dissatisfaction was associated with higher usual pain intensity, less satisfaction with physician information about pain etiology, less frequent attribution of pain to disease, sharp pain, constant and intermittent pain, patient perceptions of less physician concern about pain, patient and physician belief that the patient is receiving insufficient analgesic, and patient wanting more control over analgesic regimen. Patients may benefit from improved treatment of specific syndromes and by attention to communication.
4436074	Although the results demonstrate a need to adjust policies designed to improve utilization by accounting for particular problems faced by minority populations, they also demonstrate the primacy of addressing financial access.
12130994	Most family members were highly satisfied with the care provided to them and their critically ill relative in the intensive care unit. Efforts to improve the nature of interactions and communication with families are likely to lead to improvements in satisfaction.
12183092	End-of-life care in Canada may be improved for patients and their families by providing better psychological and spiritual support, better planning of care and enhanced relationships with physicians, especially in aspects related to communication and decision-making.
11092163	This article develops a conceptual model of cultural competency's potential to reduce racial and ethnic health disparities, using the cultural competency and disparities literature to lay the foundation for the model and inform assessments of its validity. The authors identify nine major cultural competency techniques: interpreter services, recruitment and retention policies, training, coordinating with traditional healers, use of community health workers, culturally competent health promotion, including family/community members, immersion into another culture, and administrative and organizational accommodations. The conceptual model shows how these techniques could theoretically improve the ability of health systems and their clinicians to deliver appropriate services to diverse populations, thereby improving outcomes and reducing disparities. The authors conclude that while there is substantial research evidence to suggest that cultural competency should in fact work, health systems have little evidence about which cultural competency techniques are effective and less evidence on when and how to implement them properly.
11889645	This study is one of the first to report that the use of certain cognitive coping strategies is associated with positive outcome for patients suffering from orofacial pain. These findings underscore the importance of individual differences on behavioral and psychosocial parameters in the prediction of patients' subjective evaluation of treatment outcome.
16192158	The relationship between limited health literacy and poor health may be due, in part, to poor communication quality within health care delivery organizations. We explored the relationship between health literacy status and receiving patient-centered communication in clinics and hospitals serving communication-vulnerable patient populations. Thirteen health care organizations nationwide distributed a survey to 5929 patients. All patients completed seven items assessing patient-centered communication. One third also completed three items assessing health literacy. The majority of patients had self-reported health literacy challenges, reporting problems learning about their medical condition because of difficulty understanding written information (53%), a lack of confidence in completing medical forms by themselves (61%), and needing someone to help them read hospital/clinic materials (57%). Logistic regression models showed that, after adjustment for patient demographic characteristics and health care organization type, patients with limited health literacy were 28% to 79% less likely than those with adequate health literacy to report their health care organization "always" provides patient-centered communication across seven communication items. Using a scaled composite of these items, limited health literacy remained associated with lower reported communication quality. These results suggest that improving communication quality in health care organizations might help to address the challenges facing patients with limited health literacy. They also highlight that efforts to address the needs of patients with limited health literacy should be sensitive to the range of communication challenges confronting these patients and their caregivers.
10183285	Health care report cards have been endorsed as a mechanism for efficiently comparing key quantifiable aspects of performance across a range of health systems or plans. There are challenges in determining what to measure; how to gather and analyze data; and how to report, interpret, and use findings. Mental health has received little attention, and a consumer perspective is typically not included. The proposed MHSIP mental health report card (MMHRC) addresses these concerns. General issues for report cards are discussed, and the MMHRC is described in terms of content, data sources and quality, and analysis and reporting.
8968258	Pain is common among severely ill hospitalized patients. The most important variables associated with pain and satisfaction with pain control were patient demographics and those variables that reflected the acute illness. Pain and satisfaction with pain control varied significantly among study sites, even after adjustment for many potential confounders. Better pain management strategies are needed for patients with the serious and common illnesses studied in SUPPORT.
12521327	The present study evaluates the performance of patient-centred outcome measures in the oral medicine setting in patients with oral lichen planus. The study included 48 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of oral lichen planus who completed a questionnaire incorporating two patient-centred outcome measures: the 16-item UK Oral Health Related Quality Of Life Measure (OHQOL-UK) and 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). They subsequently underwent an oral examination and rated the pain they experienced on a visual analogue scale (VAS). The impact of oral health on their life quality was considerable with physical, social and psychological consequences. Both OHQOL-UK (P<0.01) and OHIP-14 scores (P<0.01) were associated with clinical findings; demonstrating criterion validity. Patient rating of pain experienced (on a VAS) correlated with OHQOL-UK scores (P<0.01) and OHIP-14 (P<0.01); demonstrating construct validity. The mean inter-item correlation for OHQOL-UK was 0.93 and was 0.90 for OHIP-14; demonstrating high internal consistency reliability. Our results suggest both OHQOL-UK and OHIP-14, patient-centred outcome measures perform well in patients with oral lichen planus, demonstrating validity and reliability. This implies patient-centred outcome measures may be utilized in both oral medicine and oral and maxillofacial surgery to assess patient needs and opinions.
15741710	Despite substantial asthma prevalence and morbidity, children from Spanish-speaking families are at high risk of inadequate maintenance therapy. The reasons for this remain unclear. The objective of this study was to compare patterns of asthma morbidity and access to care of children with asthma from Spanish-speaking and English-speaking families. Cross-sectional data from a nationally representative sample of children with asthma 2-17 years of age were analyzed from the 1999 National Health Interview Survey, conducted in both English and Spanish, with the preferred language identified at the time of the interview. Among the 1,228 children with asthma (physician-diagnosed asthma by parent report), 66 (3%) were from Spanish-speaking families and 1,162 (97%) were from English-speaking families. In a logistic regression model adjusting for gender, insurance, poverty (above or below the federal poverty level, based on reported family income and the U.S. Poverty Threshold produced annually by the Census Bureau), and race/ethnicity, children with asthma from Spanish-speaking families were one-third less likely to have a usual health care provider (odds ratio [OR] 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1-0.8) than children with asthma from English-speaking families. Latino ethnicity was not independently associated with diminished continuity of care. These data indicate that children with asthma from Spanish-speaking families are less likely to experience continuity of health care than their counterparts from English-speaking families. Differences in continuity of care may contribute to inadequate asthma maintenance therapy among these children.
6592306	In a cross-over study, intravenous diazepam was compared with rectal diazepam for sedation in outpatient oral surgery. Fifty-four operations were performed on 27 patients. Recovery from sedation, experience during the postoperative course, amnesia, estimation of the sedative effect, and patient preference of method of sedation were studied. The recovery times of the sedation methods did not differ. Sedative effects after the first operation were estimated as good by 87% of patients given intravenous sedation and by 75% of those given rectal sedation. However, there was a significant relationship between the subjective experience of stronger sedative effect and preference of sedation method that favored the intravenous technique. The degree of amnesia was significantly higher during intravenous sedation, but a high degree of amnesia was not related to patients' preference for a sedation method. Neither sedation method produced any local side effects.
19098110	Little is known about the lived health-care experiences of persons living with palliative stage Parkinson's disease and the family members who care for them. An exploratory phenomenological investigation was adopted to understand participant's lived health-care experiences and the needs flowing from them. Three family groupings participated in semi-structured in-depth interviews. Interpretative phenomenological analysis revealed three main themes: missing information, being on your own, wanting and not wanting to know. Findings support previous research that indicate palliative care needs are not being met in our current health-care model and that palliative care services should be multi-disciplinary team-based in order to provide comprehensive support to patients and families. Based on this current work, we are currently undertaking a comprehensive quantitative-based multi-disciplinary health-care service needs assessment of palliative stage PD patients with the goal to implement expanded services.
10697808	Alternative high schools serve approximately 280,000 students nationwide who are at high risk for failing or dropping out of regular high school or who have been expelled from regular high school because of illegal activity or behavioral problems. Such settings provide important opportunities for delivering health promotion education and services to these youth and young adults. However, before this survey, the prevalence of health-risk behaviors among students attending alternative high schools nationwide was unknown. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors the following six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults: behaviors that contribute to unintentional and intentional injuries; tobacco use; alcohol and other drug use; sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (including human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection); unhealthy dietary behaviors; and physical inactivity. The national Alternative High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey (ALT-YRBS) is one component of the YRBSS; it was conducted in 1998 to measure priority health-risk behaviors among students at alternative high schools. The 1998 ALT-YRBS used a three-stage cluster sample design to produce a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9-12 in the United States who attend alternative high schools. The school response rate was 81.0%, and the student response rate was 81.9%, resulting in an overall response rate of 66.3%. This report summarizes results from the 1998 ALT-YRBS. The reporting period is February-May 1998. In the United States, 73.6% of all deaths among youth and young adults aged 10-24 years results from only four causes--motor vehicle crashes, other unintentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Results from the 1998 ALT-YRBS demonstrate that many students at alternative high schools engage in behaviors that increase their likelihood of death from these four causes. During the 30 days preceding the survey, 51.9% had ridden with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, 25.1% had driven a vehicle after drinking alcohol, 32.9% had carried a weapon, 64.5% had drunk alcohol, and 53.0% had used marijuana. During the 12 months preceding the survey, 15.7% had attempted suicide, and 29.0% had rarely or never worn a seat belt. Substantial morbidity among school-aged youth and young adults also results from unintended pregnancies and STDs, including HIV infection. ALT-YRBS results indicate that in 1998, a total of 87.8% of students at alternative high schools had had sexual intercourse, 54.1% of sexually active students had not used a condom at last sexual intercourse, and 5.7% had ever injected an illegal drug. Among adults aged > or = 25 years, 66.5% of all deaths result from two causes--cardiovascular disease and cancer. Most risk behaviors associated with these causes of death are initiated during adolescence. In 1998, a total of 64.1% of students at alternative high schools had smoked cigarettes during the 30 days preceding the survey, 38.3% had smoked a cigar during the 30 days preceding the survey, 71.2% had not eaten > or = 5 servings of fruits and vegetables during the day preceding the survey, and 81.0% had not attended physical education (PE) class daily. Comparing ALT-YRBS results with 1997 national YRBS results demonstrates that the prevalence of most risk behaviors is higher among students attending alternative high schools compared with students at regular high schools. Some risk behaviors are more common among certain sex and racial/ethnic subgroups of students. ALT-YRBS data can be used nationwide by health and education officials to improve policies and programs designed to reduce risk behaviors associated with the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among students attending alternative high schools.
10869876	Dyspnea is a devastating symptom in patients with advanced cancer. Unfortunately, very limited research has been done on the frequency and correlates of dyspnea in this particular patient population. The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the frequency of moderate to severe dyspnea and the correlates of dyspnea in a population of ambulatory terminally ill cancer patients. One hundred thirty-five consecutive patients attending a multidisciplinary pain clinic were tested for respiratory function (vital capacity, peak flow, maximal inspiratory pressure, and oxygen saturation). All patients gave their rating of dyspnea, anxiety, and fatigue/tiredness using visual analogue scales (VAS). Lung involvement by the tumor (primary or metastatic) was determined from the patient's chart. Moderate dyspnea occurred in 74/135 (55%) patients with terminal cancer. Lung involvement (r = 0.285, P = 0. 0009), anxiety (r = 0.306, P = 0.0003), fatigue/tiredness (r = 0.211, P = 0.0146), and vital capacity (r = -0.189, P = 0.0444) were significantly correlated with the intensity of dyspnea. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that lung involvement (P = 0.0016) and anxiety (P = 0.0027) were independently correlated with the intensity of dyspnea. In the subgroup of patients with moderate to severe dyspnea, multivariate analysis found anxiety (P = 0.0318) and maximal inspiratory pressure (P = 0.0187) to be independent correlates of the intensity of dyspnea. Dyspnea is a frequent symptom in patients with advanced cancer. The presence of cancer in the lungs, anxiety, and maximal inspiratory pressure are correlates of the intensity of dyspnea in this patient population. Possible treatments addressing low maximal inspiratory pressure and anxiety are needed, as well as further research in finding new correlates of dyspnea in advanced cancer patients.
12727039	The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) to explore and compare the symptom experience of seriously ill hospitalized cancer and noncancer patients near the end of life using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) and (2) to determine if the MSAS is a valid and useful measure of symptom distress for patients with noncancer conditions. This was a prospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with end-stage congestive heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease, cirrhosis, or metastatic cancer. Eligible patients were interviewed to ascertain symptom prevalence, severity and distress using the MSAS and levels of fatigue using the Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS). Sixty-six patients with metastatic cancer and 69 patients with end-stage disease were enrolled in the study. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of selected physical symptoms, but not psychological symptoms, between cancer and noncancer patients. There were no significant differences in symptom distress scores, a computed score of frequency, severity and distress, if the symptom was present. In both groups the principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation yielded one factor comprising psychological symptoms and a second factor comprising three subgroups of physical symptoms. Internal consistency was high for the psychological subscale (Cronbach alpha coefficients of 0.85 for the cancer group and 0.77 for the noncancer group) and for the physical subscale groupings, with coefficients ranging between 0.78 to 0.87. The symptom scores were significantly correlated with perceptions of fatigue. These findings show that both seriously ill cancer and noncancer patients experience symptom distress, and that the MSAS seems to be a reliable measure of symptom distress in noncancer patients, as well as with cancer patients.
8008037	Despite published guidelines for pain management, many patients with cancer have considerable pain and receive inadequate analgesia.
9477029	In a clinical follow-up study 42 patients were selected from an original sample of 335 individuals who had undergone extensive prosthetic treatment. The selection was done in accordance with a treatment satisfaction measure. The selected patients' appliances were classified in accordance with the California Dental Association (CDA) quality assessment system. Altogether, most of the new reconstructions were rated as satisfactory. The removable partial dentures had a somewhat higher share of non-acceptable appliances according to the CDA criteria. There was an association between the CDA categories and patient satisfaction. Using logistic regression analysis and knowing the CDA rating, we could correctly classify 67% of the patients with regard to the satisfaction measure. The satisfaction measure was modified on the basis of an interview, improving the model to 83% correctly classified. It was concluded that the technical quality of the prosthodontic treatment was associated with patient satisfaction.
7639882	Public health and medical care interventions have produced dramatic changes in the health of children in the United States. Emerging new morbidities such as behavioral and learning disorders, and child abuse and neglect, highlight the lack of an integrated system of health. Children's developmental vulnerability, dependency, and unique morbidities have been underemphasized in the organization and delivery of health care. The Andersen and Aday model of health care utilization is used to describe financial and nonfinancial barriers to care for children that include family characteristics and organizational characteristics of the health system. Case studies of immunization delivery, children with chronic illness, and mobile populations of children reveal the mismatch between the health care system and children's basic health needs. Integrated service models for high-risk populations of children represent an essential mechanism for coordinating the delivery of medical, developmental, educational, and social services needed by children and families. Universal, coordinated public health and medical services of adequate scope and quality should be assured for children through market and health system reform.
9592438	Migrant farmworkers are one of the most health care-impoverished populations in the United States. Mobility, hazardous occupations, cultural diversity, and low socioeconomic status place migrants, and particularly migrant children, at high risk for inadequate health care and preventable health problems. This article presents a synthesis of the existing research on migrant demographics, major health risks, and geographic, financial, and cultural barriers to health care access. Innovative nursing strategies to enhance access and improve the health of migrant children are explored. These include the use of lay community outreach workers, the creation of alternative health care delivery models, and the development of information tracking systems.
9361659	Bereaved family members are generally satisfied with life-sustaining treatment decisions. Their primary concerns are failures in communication and pain control. Discussions that focus on specific treatment decisions may not satisfy the real needs of dying patients and their families.
3352333	Although the quantity and, in many cases, the quality of research on the practitioner-patient interaction has improved over the last 10-15 years, many related topics remain largely unexplored. The relationship of the similarity of practitioner and patient preferences to treatment adherence has not been carefully investigated, either in a medical or dental setting. This paper presents a study of patient and practitioner preferences for a dental appointment, and assesses the impact of their similarity on patient satisfaction with the appointment and adherence to the recommended treatment regimen. Results indicate that the similarity of patient and dental student preferences for an appointment is a very significant predictor of patient satisfaction with the appointment, reported improvement in oral hygiene behavior, and actual improvement in objective dental health. Patient satisfaction was, in turn, an independent predictor of reported behavior change and objective improvement in dental health. Similarity of patient and practitioner preferences for appointments should be studied more carefully in future doctor- and dentist-patient interaction research, as it is a critical variable for understanding how the interaction experience is translated into patient behavior.
9854692	Priority health-risk behaviors, which contribute to the leading causes of mortality and morbidity among youth and adults, often are established during youth, extend into adulthood, and are interrelated. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults--behaviors that contribute to unintentional and intentional injuries; tobacco use; alcohol and other drug use; sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (including human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection); unhealthy dietary behaviors; and physical inactivity. The YRBSS includes a national school-based survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as state, territorial, and local school-based surveys conducted by education and health agencies. This report summarizes results from the national survey, 33 state surveys, 3 territorial surveys, and 17 local surveys conducted among high school students from February through May 1997. In the United States, 73% of all deaths among youth and young adults 10-24 years of age result from only four causes: motor vehicle crashes, other unintentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Results from the national 1997 YRBSS demonstrate that many high school students engage in behaviors that increase their likelihood of death from these four causes--19.3% had rarely or never worn a seat belt; during the 30 days preceding the survey, 36.6% had ridden with a driver who had been drinking alcohol; 18.3% had carried a weapon during the 30 days preceding the survey; 50.8% had drunk alcohol during the 30 days preceding the survey; 26.2% had used marijuana during the 30 days preceding the survey; and 7.7% had attempted suicide during the 12 months preceding the survey. Substantial morbidity among school-age youth, young adults, and their children also result from unintended pregnancies and STDs, including HIV infection. YRBSS results indicate that in 1997, 48.4% of high school students had ever had sexual intercourse; 43.2% of sexually active students had not used a condom at last sexual intercourse; and 2.1% had ever injected an illegal drug. Of all deaths and substantial morbidity among adults greater than or equal to 25 years of age, 67% result from two causes--cardiovascular disease and cancer. Most of the risk behaviors associated with these causes of death are initiated during adolescence. In 1997, 36.4% of high school students had smoked cigarettes during the 30 days preceding the survey; 70.7% had not eaten five or more servings of fruits and vegetables during the day preceding the survey; and 72.6% had not attended physical education class daily. These YRBSS data are already being used by health and education officials to improve national, state, and local policies and programs to reduce risks associated with the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. YRBSS data also are being used to measure progress toward achieving 21 national health objectives and one of the eight National Education Goals.
16466343	The objective of this study was to determine the association between continuity of care and emergency room visits/hospital care for patients with asthma. A population-based study was conducted using administrative healthcare datasets obtained from Alberta Health and Wellness, Alberta, Canada. The 4-year study period extended from April 1, 1996 to March 31, 2000, and took place at the Palliser Health Region in Alberta, Canada, which has a population of 88,000 people. A population-based sample of 2774 patients, diagnosed with asthma between ages 5 and 45 with two or more office visits for asthma and who lived in the Palliser Health Region for 2 consecutive years during the study period, was studied. The main outcome measure was the association of continuity of care with hospitalizations and emergency room visits for patients with asthma. Continuity of care was the proportion of total physician visits made to the most frequently visited physician. High continuity of care was associated with a decreased risk of an emergency visit (OR = 0.24: 95% CI 0.19-0.29), number of emergency visits (RR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.32-0.42), decreased risk of number of hospitalizations (RR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.54-0.89), and total days in hospital (average difference = 0.77; 95% CI 0.63-0.95), but not with ever hospitalized. High continuity of care was associated with a 60%-75% reduction in emergency room visits and an approximate 25% reduction in number of hospitalizations in patients with asthma. Interventions to improve continuity of care could have the potential to improve care and reduce cost.
16651291	Black children are more likely to have asthma and to experience ED visits for asthma, compared with otherwise comparable white children, and these racial disparities cannot be explained by differences in measurable child or family characteristics. These results suggest that racial disparities in asthma continue to pose risks for black children, and they point to the need for additional research into potential explanations and remedies.
12350182	Unsolicited patient complaints captured and recorded by a medical group are positively associated with physicians' risk management experiences.
15173469	National results using 4 complementary composite quality measures confirm the need for improving the quality of preventive and developmental services for young children in the United States. The 4 measures identify areas of care and subgroups of children for whom improvements in quality are most needed. The measures provide a parsimonious yet comprehensive assessment across distinct health supervision topics and 4 essential aspects of preventive and developmental services. Until valid measures of outcomes of preventive and developmental services are identified or 1 single process of care measure is shown to be highly predictive of these outcomes, assessing multiple aspects of recommended care will be necessary to assess performance of health care providers or systems of care.
3749965	This research examines preventive medical care, morbidity and mortality among children of migrant agricultural workers using a representative sample of migrant families in Wisconsin. Our findings support the view that this group is at substantially greater risk of health problems and early mortality than the general population. Fewer than half of migrant children under age 16 received the recommended annual physical checkup. Only one-third of migrant children under age 16 had received an annual dental checkup compared to 50% of children in the total population. A rough comparison between levels of chronic health conditions for migrant children and those reported for children in a national survey suggest that the incidence of chronic conditions is several times greater among migrant children. Childhood mortality appears to be 1.6 times higher than in the U.S. population. In analyzing variation in preventive care for migrant children, younger children are more likely to receive checkups, while older children are more likely to receive immunizations. In interpreting this finding, we suggest distinguishing between two types of preventive care: one under the direct control of the family, and the other controlled by the schools. Since immunizations are given to migrant children in schools, the older or school-age children are more likely to be immunized. In assessing reports of chronic conditions, we noted that mothers who spoke English were more likely to report that a child had a chronic condition. One possible interpretation is that women who do not speak English may not label various childhood conditions as chronic illnesses. Since a large proportion of women spoke only Spanish, the chronic conditions may be substantially under-reported among migrant children. The analysis of childhood mortality shows the level of mortality to be proportionally lower among women who spoke English, and higher among those who gave birth to a low birth weight child. But surprisingly, the most important characteristic related to loss of children was whether or not a mother smoked. Using smoking as one example of high risk behavior, we suggest that future studies should give closer attention to the impact of parental risk-taking behaviors on childhood morbidity and mortality experiences.
15039410	Many people dying in institutions have unmet needs for symptom amelioration, physician communication, emotional support, and being treated with respect. Family members of decedents who received care at home with hospice services were more likely to report a favorable dying experience.
10705703	To reduce racial/ethnic disparities in primary care, attention should be paid both to policies aimed at improving potential access and to providing linguistically appropriate services.
17277013	Language barriers appear to increase the risks to patient safety. It is important for patients with language barriers to have ready access to competent language services. Providers need to collect reliable language data at the patient point of entry and document the language services provided during the patient-provider encounter.
11324211	Patients with reconstruction of craniofacial or intraoral defects experience a profound impact on their quality of life (QOL). This impact on QOL is influenced by the patients' medical conditions and the treatment interventions. Instruments to measure general QOL have been available for many years. A major criticism of QOL instruments is that too often the questions are not specific to the particular problems of a disease or condition. A search of the literature regarding QOL measurement for patients with maxillofacial implant-supported prostheses produced a short list of instruments, none of which were sufficiently developed or suited to the patients involved in reconstructive treatment. This study was designed to develop pretreatment and posttreatment questionnaires for measuring QOL for patients with reconstruction of a craniofacial defect and patients with reconstruction of loss of specific intraoral structures utilizing an implant-supported prosthesis (e.g., severe resorption of the maxilla or mandible or both). The goal was to develop brief, targeted instruments for this specific patient population. The produced instruments were sensitive and easy to administer and score, and no disruption of clinical care occurred with the administration of the questionnaires. The instruments were used with equal success both in face-to-face interviews and via mail.
6824257	The quality of physician-patient communication affects important health care outcomes. Managed care presents a number of challenges to physician-patient communication, including shorter visits, decreased continuity, and lower levels of trust. Good communication skills can help physicians create and maintain healthy relationships with patients in the face of these challenges. We describe 5 communication dilemmas that are common in managed care and review possible solutions suggested by recent literature on physician-patient communication. We also describe ways that managed care plans can promote more effective communication between physicians and patients.
15249562	Delirium was an independent predictor of higher 6-month mortality and longer hospital stay even after adjusting for relevant covariates including coma, sedatives, and analgesics in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.
9475476	Health plans need to pay increased attention to racial/ethnic differences in assessments of care. This study's finding that language barriers are largely responsible for racial/ethnic disparities in care suggests that linguistically appropriate health care services are needed to address these gaps.
9413309	Improvements in quality of care for Asians/Pacific Islanders are needed. Comparisons of care in racially and ethnically diverse populations based on global ratings of care should be interpreted cautiously.
12165584	Recent data suggest that the burden from childhood asthma may have recently plateaued after several years of increasing, although additional years of data collection are necessary to confirm a change in trend. Racial and ethnic disparities remain large for asthma health care utilization and mortality.
11483786	The P3C is a practical, reliable, and valid measure of parents' reports of pediatric primary care quality. This brief measure could be used alone, or in conjunction with other measures, to enhance outcomes and evaluate the impact of systems changes on the delivery of the main elements of primary care.
12620760	Loss of dignity is closely associated with certain types of distress often seen among the terminally ill. Preservation of dignity should be an overall aim of treatment and care in patients who are nearing death.
20736823	Assessing and analyzing family satisfaction in the ICU ultimately will support healthcare professionals in their continuing effort to improve care of critically ill patients and their families.
20445131	Effective communication is critical to providing quality health care and can be affected by a number of modifiable organizational factors. The authors performed a prospective multisite validation study of an organizational communication climate assessment tool in 13 geographically and ethnically diverse health care organizations. Communication climate was measured across 9 discrete domains. Patient and staff surveys with matched items in each domain were developed using a national consensus process, which then underwent psychometric field testing and assessment of domain coherence. The authors found meaningful within-site and between-site performance score variability in all domains. In multivariable models, most communication domains were significant predictors of patient-reported quality of care and trust. The authors conclude that these assessment tools provide a valid empirical assessment of organizational communication climate in 9 domains. Assessment results may be useful to track organizational performance, to benchmark, and to inform tailored quality improvement interventions.
17664258	Parents of patients at resident continuity sites rated residents as providers of high-quality care to a socioeconomically disadvantaged population as compared with a previously published community sample. Efforts to improve resident continuity and identification may help improve care delivered in resident practices.
11230593	Lower continuity of primary care is associated with higher risk of ED utilization and hospitalization. Efforts to improve and maintain continuity may be warranted.
15849881	In general, most measures have not undergone rigorous development and testing. Measure development in end-of-life care should focus on areas with identified gaps, and testing should be done to facilitate comparability across the care settings, populations, and clinical conditions. Intervention research should use robust measures that adhere to these standards.
10439490	Improved communication between patients and providers, and continuity of care are associated with increased provision of preventive services, while other aspects of PCC are not strongly related to delivery of preventive services.
10121552	Migrant farmworkers lead a hard life filled with strenuous work, stress, and anxiety about employment; live under substandard conditions; and rarely get the health care they require. Preventive care is a luxury they cannot afford. Year-round nutritious meals are rarely possible, due to long working hours, traveling, and living in housing without adequate cooking and refrigeration facilities. Children may attend up to six or more schools during the course of a school year. Crowded housing conditions support the invasion of parasites, infectious diseases, and viral infections. Dermatological conditions from working around a wide variety of plants, dirt, and in the sun are frequent. Exposure to pesticides, herbicides, and other chemical additives creates the likelihood of acute reactions, such as headaches and rashes, and also puts workers at risk of developing chronic diseases as the level of exposure rises because of accumulation and mix of various chemicals. Yet, we know little about the health status of this population. We are unable to estimate crude death rates, age-specific death rates, or prevalence rates of most common causes of death, such as heart disease,cancer and stroke. There is no information about occupational accident rates, infectious disease rates, or even postneonatal mortality. We do know that when migrants go to a clinic, they are often likely to have the chronic conditions of hypertension or diabetes. They present symptoms of acute conditions such as dental problems, dermatitis, otitis media among children, and acute upper respiratory infections. Women frequently need obstetrical care, reflected (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
19060254	DrScore.com an online patient satisfaction survey, uses 2 patient satisfaction scales, namely, satisfaction with physician care and satisfaction with office policy and procedures, including accessibility to care, convenience of office and practice location, and staff friendliness. This study assesses the validity and reliability of the scales. The sample includes 11,212 specialty care visits, comprised of 64% women, 82% established patients, and 24% routine visits. A confirmatory factor analysis is used to test factor structure. Convergent validity also is examined. The goodness-of-fit index is 0.99, and standardized factor loadings are uniformly high, exceeding 0.90 for all but 2 items. Cronbach alpha is 0.99 for the physician scale and 0.94 for the office scale. Both scales discriminate other satisfaction indicators. Correlation between scales is high at 0.90. Both scales possess excellent psychometric properties but are not clearly differentiated. Results agree with the unidimensional view of patient satisfaction and confirm that online surveys can be reliable and valid.
1714500	The lack of control of physical suffering among cancer patients in the last days or hours of life is a common medical problem but it is rarely discussed in an open fashion. We carried out a prospective study of the dying of 120 terminal cancer patients assisted by a home care team. We documented how long it was before death that physical symptoms, unendurable to the patient and controlled only by sedation-inducing sleep, appeared. In 63 patients (52.5%), unendurable symptoms due to tumor progression or irreversible acute organic phenomena appeared, on average two days before death. Of the 63 patients, 47 had only one uncontrollable symptom, 15 had two symptoms and one patient had three symptoms. The most common symptoms included dyspnea (33 patients), pain (31), delirium (11), and vomiting (5). The most frequent symptoms were dyspnea in lung and head and neck disease; pain in breast, gastrointestinal tract, colon-rectum, and male genitourinary tract cancer; and vomiting in female genitourinary tract malignancies. Data reported emphasize the clinical relevance of physical symptoms in the last days of life in terminal cancer patients and how these serve to indicate imminent death. More than 50% of these patients die with physical suffering that is controllable only by means of sedation.
9783878	The social policy background to the proliferation of patient satisfaction surveys is a desire for increased patient representation and participation. Within this context, it is assumed that satisfaction surveys embody patients' evaluations of services. However, as most surveys report high satisfaction levels, the interpretation of satisfaction as the outcome of an active evaluation has been called into question. The aim of this study is to identify whether and how service users evaluate services. This was made possible through unstructured in-depth interviews with users of mental health services and through more structured discussion around their responses on a patient satisfaction questionnaire (CSQ 18B) whose psychometric properties has been well documented. Twenty-nine people with current or recent contact with mental health services within the British National Health Service were interviewed. The data revealed that service users frequently described their experiences in positive or negative terms. However, the process by which these experiences were transformed into "evaluations" of the service was complex. Consequently, many expressions of "satisfaction" on the CSQ 18B hid a variety of reported negative experiences. An explanation for this lack of correspondence is outlined.
10819707	Despite a recent increase in the attention given to improving end-of-life care, our understanding of what constitutes a good death is surprisingly lacking. The purpose of this study was to gather descriptions of the components of a good death from patients, families, and providers through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Seventy-five participants-including physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, hospice volunteers, patients, and recently bereaved family members-were recruited from a university medical center, a Veterans Affairs medical center, and a community hospice. Participants identified six major components of a good death: pain and symptom management, clear decision making, preparation for death, completion, contributing to others, and affirmation of the whole person. The six themes are process-oriented attributes of a good death, and each has biomedical, psychological, social, and spiritual components. Physicians' discussions of a good death differed greatly from those of other groups. Physicians offered the most biomedical perspective, and patients, families, and other health care professionals defined a broad range of attributes integral to the quality of dying. Although there is no "right" way to die, these six themes may be used as a framework for understanding what participants tend to value at the end of life. Biomedical care is critical, but it is only a point of departure toward total end-of-life care. For patients and families, psychosocial and spiritual issues are as important as physiologic concerns.
11115223	Patients from racial and ethnic minority groups have less positive perceptions of their physicians on at least 2 important dimensions. The reasons for these differences should be explored and addressed. Arch Fam Med. 2000;9:1156-1163
15586831	Communication in medical care is highly correlated with better patient adherence, and training physicians to communicate better enhances their patients' adherence. Findings can contribute to medical education and to interventions to improve adherence, supporting arguments that communication is important and resources devoted to improving it are worth investing in. Communication is thus an important factor over which physicians have some control in helping their patients to adhere.
14702502	There are several instruments designed to measure health care quality for children. Despite this, we found relatively few measures for assessing patient safety and living with illness and none for end-of-life care. Few measures are designed for specific age categories among children. Although equity is an overarching concern in health care quality, the application of current measures to assess disparities has been limited. These areas need additional research and development for a more complete assessment of health care quality for children.
16966670	Seriously ill patients and family members have defined the importance of various elements related to quality end-of-life care. The most important elements related to trust in the treating physician, avoidance of unwanted life support, effective communication, continuity of care and life completion. Variation in the perception of what matters the most indicates the need for customized or individualized approaches to providing end-of-life care.
9245237	Most elderly and seriously ill patients died in acute care hospitals. Pain and other symptoms were commonplace and troubling to patients. Family members believed that patients preferred comfort, but life-sustaining treatments were often used. These findings indicate important opportunities to improve the care of dying patients.
8725975	A regular source of care is the single most important factor associated with the receipt of preventive services, but optimal primary care from a regular place increases the likelihood that women will receive preventive care.
2646486	Growing interest in the doctor-patient relationship focuses attention on the specific elements of that relationship that affect patients' health outcomes. Data are presented for four clinical trials conducted in varied practice settings among chronically ill patients differing markedly in sociodemographic characteristics. These trials demonstrated that "better health" measured physiologically (blood pressure or blood sugar), behaviorally (functional status), or more subjectively (evaluations of overall health status) was consistently related to specific aspects of physician-patient communication. We conclude that the physician-patient relationship may be an important influence on patients' health outcomes and must be taken into account in light of current changes in the health care delivery system that may place this relationship at risk.

11104104	The perceived inability to cope and care-seeking patterns are two unexplored dimensions of the toothache pain experience. Both dimensions may be associated with pain intensity, the clinical conditions that manifest as toothache, quality of treatment provided and management of demand for emergency dental care. A conceptual framework is proposed for future research to investigate these relationships.

23064276	Quality improvement efforts may be needed to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in beneficiary experience with PD coverage. Cultural, language, and health literacy barriers in navigating Medicare's Part D program may partially explain the observed disparities.
8668408	Reliance on hospital emergency departments for routine sick care is strongly associated with demographic and social characteristics of the child and family, the type and source of available well child care, and the supply of primary care physicians. Because health insurance status was not a significant predictor of use, public policies aimed at reducing the use of emergency departments by children will need to address other factors. These include the organizational characteristics and responsiveness of the health care system and the motivation of families for routine use of hospital emergency departments.
10809466	Patients reported increasing functional impairments and limited quality of life. The majority preferred comfort care. The number of patients in severe pain was substantial. Before death, the majority had measures in place to limit aggressive care.
17845883	Family needs were categorized according to Leske's dimensions of assurance, proximity, information, comfort, and support. By implementing specific cost-effective strategies to increase family access to the patient, to improve communication with the physician and the health care team, and to create a family-friendly environment, critical care RNs can meet family member needs and improve the quality of nursing care.
9655308	The MSAS physical symptom subscale score significantly predicts survival and adds to the prognostic information provided by KPS and extent of disease. Patients may be under-assessed regarding both the number and the severity of symptoms. Measurements of physical symptoms and related distress offer additional prognostic information concerning the survival of patients with cancer and may account for the predictive value of QOL scores.
20945098	This study explores cultural differences in perceptions of quality of care and examines whether existing surveys, such as the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS()) questionnaires, adequately capture conceptions of healthcare quality among members of racial/ethnic minority groups. Eight focus groups with African Americans, Asian Indians, Latinos, and whites were organized into two 45-minute segments. In one segment, participants rated the quality of care depicted in a video; in the other they discussed the concept of "healthcare quality." We found that members of racial/ethnic minority groups are more likely than whites to identify cultural competency and providing a holistic approach to care as important to healthcare quality. Neither of these concepts is currently included in the core CAHPS() questionnaire. The CAHPS() and other quality surveys may not accurately capture concepts of healthcare quality that members of racial/ethnic minority groups deem most important.
18047495	The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to better understand the conceptualization of satisfaction with end-of-life care and the effectiveness of palliative care interventions on this outcome. Data sources included Medline and the Database of Reviews of Effects. The review included relevant qualitative studies and intervention studies using satisfaction as an outcome from 1990 to 2005. Reviewing 24,423 citations yielded 21 relevant qualitative studies, four systematic reviews, and eight additional intervention studies. The qualitative literature described the domains of accessibility and coordination; competence, including symptom management; communication and education; emotional support and personalization of care; and support of patients' decision-making. For collaboration and consultation interventions, eight of 13 studies showed a significant effect on satisfaction. A meta-analysis found that palliative care and hospice teams improved satisfaction, although most studies did not include satisfaction as an outcome. For other types of interventions, only two of six showed a significant effect. For heart failure coordination of care, only seven of 32 studies addressed this as an outcome; two of the three that compared satisfaction between groups showed a significant difference. Evaluations used many different measures, only one of which was designed for the end of life. In conclusion, researchers have conceptualized satisfaction in palliative care, and different types of palliative care interventions can improve satisfaction, but it is often not included as an outcome. More focus on these satisfaction elements might improve the effectiveness of end-of-life interventions and their evaluation.
12093969	The American Academy of Pediatrics proposed a definition of the medical home in a 1992 policy statement. Efforts to establish medical homes for all children have encountered many challenges, including the existence of multiple interpretations of the "medical home" concept and the lack of adequate reimbursement for services provided by physicians caring for children in a medical home. This new policy statement contains an expanded and more comprehensive interpretation of the concept and an operational definition of the medical home.
18688050	The Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system has created a national initiative to measure quality of care at the end of life. This article describes the first phase of this national initiative, the Family Assessment of Treatment at End of Life (FATE), in evaluating the quality of end-of-life care for veterans dying with cancer. In the initial phase, next of kin of patients from five VA Medical Centers were contacted 6 weeks after patients' deaths and invited to participate in a telephone interview, and surrogates for 262 cancer patients completed FATE interviews. Decedents were 98% male with an average age of 72 years. There was substantial variation among sites. Higher FATE scores, consistent with family reports of higher satisfaction with care, were associated with palliative care consultation and hospice referral and having a Do Not Resuscitate order at the time of death, whereas an intensive care unit death was associated with lower scores. Early experience with FATE suggests that it will be a helpful tool to characterize end-of-life cancer care and to identify targets for quality improvement.
