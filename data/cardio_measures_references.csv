16549637	This administrative claims-based model for profiling hospitals performs consistently over several years and produces estimates of risk-standardized mortality that are good surrogates for estimates from a medical record model.
18540730	The authors conducted a meta-analytic review to assess the prevalence of major depressive disorder and depressive symptoms among Latinos compared with non-Latino Whites in the United States using community-based data. Random-effects estimates were calculated for 8 studies meeting inclusion criteria that reported lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (combined N = 76,270) and for 23 studies meeting inclusion criteria that reported current prevalence of depressive symptoms (combined N = 38,997). Findings did not indicate a group difference in lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (odds ratio = 0.89, 95% confidence interval = 0.72, 1.10). Latinos reported more depressive symptoms than non-Latino Whites (standardized mean difference = 0.19, 95% confidence interval = 0.12, 0.25); however, this effect was small and does not appear to suggest a clinically meaningful preponderance of depressive symptoms among Latinos. Findings are examined in the context of theories on vulnerability and resilience, and recommendations for future research are discussed.
16120847	These recommendations should be equally applicable to stroke patients receiving rehabilitation in all medical system settings and are not based on clinical problems or resources unique to the Federal Medical System.
19819502	The proportion of STEMI patients treated with reperfusion has improved but the interval to its application has not been shortened. To improve the latter it is mandatory an earlier contact with the medical system, a shortening of the intervals door-needle and door-balloon through better coordination between the 061, the sanitary personnel and the hospital administration, and to consider the subject as a real sanitary priority.
16442483	Little attention has been paid to the symptom management needs of patients with life-threatening diseases other than cancer. In this study, we aimed to determine to what extent patients with progressive chronic diseases have similar symptom profiles. A systematic search of medical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) and textbooks identified 64 original studies reporting the prevalence of 11 common symptoms among end-stage patients with cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or renal disease. Analyzing the data in a comparative table (a grid), we found that the prevalence of the 11 symptoms was often widely but homogeneously spread across the five diseases. Three symptoms-pain, breathlessness, and fatigue-were found among more than 50% of patients, for all five diseases. There appears to be a common pathway toward death for malignant and nonmalignant diseases. The designs of symptom prevalence studies need to be improved because of methodological disparities in symptom assessment and designs.
12093204	Aspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances, but more research into this strategy is needed.
8151849	Major depression in patients hospitalized following an MI is an independent risk factor for mortality at 6 months. Its impact is at least equivalent to that of left ventricular dysfunction (Killip class) and history of previous MI. Additional study is needed to determine whether treatment of depression can influence post-MI survival and to assess possible underlying mechanisms.
12625795	Many depressed patients present to primary care physicians instead of psychiatrists, and several studies have found that primary care physicians underdiagnose and undertreat depression. Primary care physicians may fail to diagnose and treat depression for many reasons: depression as it appears in primary care is in many ways a different disease than that seen in the psychiatric setting, and the process of detecting and treating it is different as well. Primary care clinicians face 2 main tasks when addressing depression in routine practice: to accurately identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from antidepressant treatment and to provide the best treatment options possible in the limited time available per visit. Treatment algorithms can be useful, but they are often difficult to apply in primary care. This article reviews the evidence about the detection and treatment of depression in primary care, examines current research on the differences between the primary and specialty care environments, and discusses aspects of treatment guidelines and algorithms that are important to primary care physicians.
12583858	This blood-pressure-lowering regimen reduced the risk of stroke among both hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Combination therapy with perindopril and indapamide produced larger blood pressure reductions and larger risk reductions than did single drug therapy with perindopril alone. Treatment with these two agents should now be considered routinely for patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, irrespective of their blood pressure.
17606951	Accounting models provide less precise estimates of disease burden than do econometric models. The authors seek to improve these estimates for cardiovascular disease using a nationally representative survey and econometric modeling to isolate the proportion of medical expenditures attributable to four chronic cardiovascular diseases: stroke, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and other heart diseases. Approximately 17% of all medical expenditures, or $149 billion annually, and nearly 30% of Medicare expenditures are attributable to these diseases. Of the four diseases, hypertension accounts for the largest share of prescription expenditures across payers and the largest share of all Medicaid expenditures. The large number of people with cardiovascular disease who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid could lead to large shifts in the burden to these payers as prescription drug coverage is included in Medicare. A societal perspective is important when describing the economic burden of cardiovascular disease.
17826154	Depression produces the greatest decrement in health compared with the chronic diseases angina, arthritis, asthma, and diabetes. The comorbid state of depression incrementally worsens health compared with depression alone, with any of the chronic diseases alone, and with any combination of chronic diseases without depression. These results indicate the urgency of addressing depression as a public-health priority to reduce disease burden and disability, and to improve the overall health of populations.
11694107	Essential hypertension is the most common diagnosis in US primary care settings for middle-aged persons and seniors. Yet, data on hypertension screening, treatment, and control in such settings are limited. We analyzed National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data to examine the rates of and factors associated with hypertension screening, treatment, and control during US office visits in 2003 and 2004. Blood pressure was measured in 56% (95% confidence limits: 52% to 59%) of all visits by patients > or =18 years of age and in 93% (95% confidence limits: 89% to 96%) of hypertensive patient visits. Among the latter, 62% (95% confidence limits: 55% to 69%) were treated. Diuretics were the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive agents (46%; 95% confidence limits: 41% to 50%), and combination therapy was reported in 58% (95% confidence limits: 54% to 63%) of treated visits. Only 39% (95% confidence limits: 34% to 43%) of treated visits were at recommended blood pressure goals. The odds of not being screened for hypertension were notably greater for visits with a provider other than a primary care physician or cardiologist (10.0; 95% confidence limits: 5.5 to 16.7) and for nonwell care visits (5.6; 95% confidence limits: 3.6 to 8.3). Greater odds of not being treated for hypertension were noted by geographic region (South versus Northeast: 2.6; 95% confidence limits: 1.2 to 5.6) and visit type (first time versus return visits; 1.6; 95% confidence limits: 1.1 to 2.4). The odds of not having blood pressure controlled were greater for patients with comorbidities (1.6; 95% confidence limits: 1.1 to 2.4). In conclusion, more intervention efforts are needed to further reduce the gaps and variations in routine practice in relation to evidence-based practice guidelines for hypertension screening, treatment, and control.
19681102	Ischemic stroke tPA treatment within 4.5h seems to improve functional outcomes and increases symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates without significantly increasing mortality.
17418085	Bisphosphonates are effective in the prevention and treatment of bone disease in multiple myeloma (MM). Osteonecrosis of the jaw is Increasingly recognized as a serious complication of long-term bisphosphonate therapy. Issues such as the choice of bisphosphonate and duration of therapy have become the subject of intense debate given patient safety concerns. We reviewed available data concerning the use of bisphosphonates in MM. Guidelines for the use of bisphosphonates in MM were developed by a multidisciplinary panel consisting of hematologists, dental specialists, and nurses specializing in the treatment of MM. We conclude that intravenous pamidronate and intravenous zoledronic acid are equally effective and superior to placebo in reducing skeletal complications. Pamidronate is favored over zoledronic acid until more data are available on the risk of complications (osteonecrosis of the jaw). We recommend discontinuing bisphosphonates after 2 years of therapy for patients who achieve complete response and/or plateau phase. For patients whose disease is active, who have not achieved a response, or who have threatening bone disease beyond 2 years, therapy can be decreased to every 3 months. These guidelines were developed in the Interest of patient safety and will be reexamined as new data emerge regarding risks and benefits.
2014943	Our data indicated that alternate-day aspirin therapy greatly reduced the risk for first myocardial infarction among patients with chronic stable angina, a group of patients at high risk for cardiovascular death (P less than 0.001). Although our results for stroke were based on small numbers, they suggested an apparent increase in frequency of stroke with aspirin therapy; this finding requires confirmation in randomized trials of adequate sample size.
1550000	The effect of participation in cardiac rehabilitation on medical costs was determined by measuring hospitalization charges for cardiac admissions over a 3-year period in 580 post-coronary event patients (58% after coronary bypass surgery, 42% after myocardial infarction), of whom 230 entered a cardiac rehabilitation program and 350 did not. Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction was similar in entrants and nonentrants (59.9% vs 59.5%). Over the 1 to 46-month follow-up period (mean 21 months), per capita hospitalization charges for participants in cardiac rehabilitation were $739 lower than charges for nonparticipants ($1197 +/- 3911 vs $1936 +/- 5459, p = 0.022). This was due to both a lower incidence of hospitalizations and lower charges per hospitalization. Inasmuch as groups differed with regard to age, sex, diagnostic category, and smoking status, data were adjusted for these baseline differences by means of analysis of covariance. Rehospitalization charges remained significantly higher in nonparticipants (p = 0.015). Because physician charges were not measured, the cost differential between groups is underestimated. Results of this study show an association between participation in comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation and lowered cardiac rehospitalization costs in the years after an acute coronary event.
21678374	Although we have been able to expand the number of participants by 16% in this update, we still find paucity of data on outcomes and the bias risk of the trials was mostly considered high. Targeting intensive glycaemic control compared with conventional glycaemic control did not show significant differences for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Targeting intensive glycaemic control seemed to reduce the risk of microvascular complications, if we disregard the risks of bias, but increases the risk of hypoglycaemia and serious adverse events.
15078788	Most deaths from pulmonary embolism among patients hospitalized for other conditions occurred in the setting of failed prophylaxis rather than omitted prophylaxis. High-risk patients, especially medical service patients, warrant intensive VTE prophylaxis and close follow-up to ensure successful outcomes.
15487094	A comprehensive transitional care intervention for elders hospitalized with heart failure increased the length of time between hospital discharge and readmission or death, reduced total number of rehospitalizations, and decreased healthcare costs, thus demonstrating great promise for improving clinical and economic outcomes.
17911503	In the Medicare population, women are significantly less likely than men to receive ICD therapy for primary or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death.
18212309	Less than 40% of potentially eligible patients hospitalized for heart failure received ICD therapy, and rates of use were lower among eligible women and black patients than among white men.
19021225	Low-income children with SCD demonstrate significantly higher healthcare utilization for inpatient care, emergency center care, and home health care compared to children with similar socio-demographic characteristics. A substantial proportion of children with SCD may fail to meet minimum guidelines for outpatient primary and hematology comprehensive care.

17509812	The suffering of patients with incurable cancer is determined to a large degree by the presence and intensity of the symptoms of their disease. Knowledge of symptom prevalence is important for clinical practice. The main aim of this study was to obtain a reliable estimation of symptom prevalence in patients with incurable cancer by performing a systematic review of studies assessing this topic. We included 44 studies (including 25,074 patients) on overall symptom prevalence (Group 1) and six studies (including 2,219 patients) on symptom prevalence during the last one to two weeks of life (Group 2). In these studies, symptom prevalence was assessed by a questionnaire, a standardized interview, or the medical record. We identified 37 symptoms assessed in at least five studies. Almost all symptoms occurred in more than 10% of the patients. Five symptoms (fatigue, pain, lack of energy, weakness, and appetite loss) occurred in more than 50% of the patients of Group 1. Weight loss occurred significantly more often in Group 2 compared to Group 1, and pain, nausea, and urinary symptoms occurred significantly less often. Generally, symptom prevalence was highest if assessed by a questionnaire. The results of this study should be used to guide doctors and nurses in symptom management. Proper attention to symptom burden and suffering should be the basis for individually tailored treatment aimed at improving or maintaining quality of life of patients in their last period of life.
12506938	Ramipril significantly reduces the rates of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in a broad range of high-risk patients who are not known to have a low ejection fraction or heart failure.
18235423	Each year, approximately 865,000 persons in the United States have a myocardial infarction (i.e., heart attack). In 2007, direct and indirect costs of heart disease were estimated at approximately $277.1 billion. Cardiac rehabilitation, an essential component of recovery care after a heart attack, focuses on cardiovascular risk reduction, promoting healthy behaviors, reducing death and disability, and promoting an active lifestyle for heart attack survivors. Current guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation emphasize the importance of cardiac rehabilitation, which reduces morbidity and mortality, improves clinical outcomes, enhances psychological recovery, and decreases the risk for secondary cardiac events. To estimate the prevalence of receipt of outpatient cardiac rehabilitation among heart attack survivors in 21 states and the District of Columbia (DC), data from the 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) were assessed. The results of that assessment indicated that 34.7% of BRFSS respondents who had experienced a heart attack participated in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation for eligible patients after a heart attack is an essential component of care that should be incorporated into treatment plans. Increasing the number of persons who participate in cardiac rehabilitation services also can reduce health-care costs for recurrent events and reduce the burden on families and caregivers of patients with serious sequelae.
15784104	Adults with asthma and documented concomitant AR experienced more asthma-related hospitalizations and GP visits, and incurred higher asthma drug costs than did adults with asthma alone. A unified treatment strategy for asthma and AR might reduce the costs of treating these conditions.
18294565	Current risk schemes have comparable, but only limited, overall ability to predict thromboembolism in persons with AF. Recommendations for antithrombotic therapy may vary widely depending on which scheme is applied for individual patients. Better risk stratification is crucially needed to improve selection of AF patients for anticoagulant therapy.
16973925	The aim of this new statement is to provide comprehensive and timely evidence-based recommendations on the prevention of ischemic stroke among survivors of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Evidence-based recommendations are included for the control of risk factors, interventional approaches for atherosclerotic disease, antithrombotic treatments for cardioembolism, and the use of antiplatelet agents for noncardioembolic stroke. Further recommendations are provided for the prevention of recurrent stroke in a variety of other specific circumstances, including arterial dissections; patent foramen ovale; hyperhomocysteinemia; hypercoagulable states; sickle cell disease; cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; stroke among women, particularly with regard to pregnancy and the use of postmenopausal hormones; the use of anticoagulation after cerebral hemorrhage; and special approaches for the implementation of guidelines and their use in high-risk populations.
17975193	Automated review of EHR data to measure the quality of care of outpatients with heart failure missed many exclusion criteria for medications documented only in providers' notes. As a result, it sometimes underestimated performance on medication-based quality measures.
1978091	796 men with unstable coronary artery disease (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction [MI] ), were randomised to double-blind placebo-controlled treatment with oral aspirin 75 mg/day and/or 5 days of intermittent intravenous heparin. The risk of MI and death was reduced by aspirin. After 5 days the risk ratio was 0.43 (confidence intervals, 0.21-0.91), at 1 month 0.31 (0.18-0.53), and at 3 months 0.36 (0.23-0.57). Aspirin reduced event rate in non-Q-wave MI and unstable angina, independently of electrocardiographic abnormalities or concurrent drug therapy. Heparin had no significant influence on event rate, although the group treated with aspirin and heparin had the lowest number of events during the initial 5 days. Treatment had few side-effects and high patient compliance.
17185305	Both physician and patient factors play a part in CR enrollment. Patient CR barriers should be addressed during referral discussions, and reasons why physicians fail to uniformly endorse CR exploration. Although distance to CR was related to patient enrollment patterns, greater access to home-based CR services should be provided.
20448205	Management of patients with acute ischemic stroke remains multifaceted and includes several aspects of care that have not been tested in clinical trials. This statement includes recommendations for management from the first contact by emergency medical services personnel through initial admission to the hospital. Intravenous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator remains the most beneficial proven intervention for emergency treatment of stroke. Several interventions, including intra-arterial administration of thrombolytic agents and mechanical interventions, show promise. Because many of the recommendations are based on limited data, additional research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke is needed.
18364644	These data support the routine assessment of high-risk behavioral characteristics in patients with CAD and demonstrate the marked improvements that occur after phase II CRET programs in CAD patients with high psychological distress.
11980514	Current management of advanced heart failure is based more on consensus than on randomized trials. Systematic investigation should address not only new therapies but also strategies for selecting and optimizing therapies already available.
8998892	The use of different types of antithrombotic prophylactics in various clinical settings was examined. A standardized questionnaire was mailed to 5000 randomly selected practicing orthopaedic surgeons that detailed practice profile, surgical case type and frequency, method of thromboembolism prophylaxis used, incidence of morbidity, and type of screening used. Twenty-one percent (n = 1046) of surgeons surveyed returned the questionnaire. Four of 5 surgeons performing elective hip arthroplasty used some form of thromboembolic prophylaxis for all of their patients, 13% used prophylaxis only for patients considered to be at high risk, and 3% of respondents never used prophylaxis. The rates of prophylactic use for patients undergoing elective knee arthroplasty were similar. A considerably lower rate of routine prophylactic use was seen among surgeons performing surgery for pelvic and lower extremity trauma. Except for cases involving neurologic compromise, most patients undergoing either elective or traumatic spinal surgery were not given prophylaxis. Low dose warfarin alone was the most commonly used prophylaxis modality. A comparison of the results of the current survey with those of past surveys showed that the use of aspirin has fallen. The use of routine pharmacologic prophylaxis against thromboembolism in hip and knee arthroplasty has become the standard of care in the United States. Among patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture and other lower extremity trauma, however, prophylaxis remains underused.
16084283	The goal of risk stratification of CVD inpatients with CKD is to lead to effective and early intervention and to prevent the adverse outcomes associated with this complex multisystem disease that is characteristic of growing number of patients with CKD in the general population and of patients receiving dialysis therapy or kidney transplantation. By 2030, there will be 2.24 million patients with ESRD in the United States, and approximately 1.3 million of these cases of ESRD will be caused by diabetes mellitus. Thus, CVD in this high-risk population presents a challenge for the nephrology and the cardiology community.
9935025	The underuse of echocardiography appears to be associated with poorer survival and underuse of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy.
15983428	Analgesia and hydration remain the only safe treatment for painful crises of sickle cell disease; hydroxyurea is effective, but the toxicity is still a problem. Piracetam is a nootropic drug that has reportedly been effective and non-toxic in sickle cell patients, but most studies were not placebo-controlled and included a small number of patients. The present study evaluated the drug in a double-blind crossed placebo-controlled clinical trial in 73 children and adolescents suffering from moderate to severe painful crises for 13 months. Information regarding frequency and severity of pain was acquired through monthly clinical evaluation, visits and house calls, and 4,300 weekly questionnaires filled out by the patients in their domiciles. A monthly pain score was calculated for each patient. Pain was the most frequent adverse manifestation of the disease stressing its significant bio-psycho-social impact. Although nearly all patients and relatives reported a better clinical course throughout the whole study, the drug was ineffective in the prevention of painful crises. This placebo effect may be ascribed to an unplanned and unsystematic 'cognitive-behavioural' management of the children. The pain score in the second semester of the study - both in the experimental and in the control groups - was significantly smaller than that in the first semester. In conclusion, piracetam was found to be ineffective in the prevention of painful crises; a powerful placebo effect due to adequate patient care was demonstrated.
17597785	Early identification of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may allow health-care systems to implement interventions aimed at decreasing disease progression and eventual morbidity and mortality. Primary care in the United Kingdom is computerized suggesting a separate screening program for CKD may not be necessary because identifying data already populates primary care databases. Our study utilized a data set of 163 demographic, laboratory, diagnosis, and prescription variables from 130 226 adults in the regions of Kent, Manchester, and Surrey. The patients were 18 years of age and older in a 5-year study period culminating in November 2003. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated from the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation using calibrated creatinine levels. A valid creatinine value was recorded in almost 30% of this cohort. The age-standardized prevalence of stage 3-5 CKD was 10.6% for females and 5.8% for males. In these patients, the odds ratio for hypertension was 2.1, for diabetes 1.33, and for cardiovascular disease 1.69. Only 20% of the diabetic people with stage 3-5 CKD had a blood pressure less than or equal to 130/80 mm Hg. The proportion of patients with anemia significantly rose as renal function declined. We suggest that stage 3-5 CKD is easily detected in existing computerized records. The associated comorbidity and management is readily available enabling intervention and targeting of specialist resources.
2788396	Two hundred eighty-three patients admitted to cardiac care units for myocardial infarction at two urban teaching hospitals were interviewed 8 to 10 days after infarction and 171 were reinterviewed 3 to 4 months later. Initially, 45% met diagnostic criteria for minor or major depression, including 18% with major depressive syndromes. Depression was not associated with the severity of cardiac illness but was associated with the presence of noncardiac medical illnesses. Three to 4 months after infarction, 33% of patients met criteria for minor or major depression. The large majority of patients who initially met criteria for major but not minor depression showed evidence of depression at 3 months and most patients with major depression had not returned to work by 3 months. Treatment of major depressive syndromes after myocardial infarction may reduce chronicity and disability, while minor depressive syndromes may be similar to normal grief and tend to be self-limited.
15947368	This article discusses the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following. We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A). For moderate-risk general surgery patients, we recommend prophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) (5,000 U bid) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) [< or = 3,400 U once daily] (both Grade 1A). For higher risk general surgery patients, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with LDUH (5,000 U tid) or LMWH (> 3,400 U daily) [both Grade 1A]. For high-risk general surgery patients with multiple risk factors, we recommend combining pharmacologic methods (LDUH three times daily or LMWH, > 3,400 U daily) with the use of graduated compression stockings and/or intermittent pneumatic compression devices (Grade 1C+). We recommend that thromboprophylaxis be used in all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery (Grade 1A) or major, open urologic procedures, and we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH two times or three times daily (Grade 1A). For patients undergoing elective total hip or knee arthroplasty, we recommend one of the following three anticoagulant agents: LMWH, fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [international normalized ratio (INR) target, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0] (all Grade 1A). For patients undergoing hip fracture surgery (HFS), we recommend the routine use of fondaparinux (Grade 1A), LMWH (Grade 1C+), VKA (target INR, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 2B], or LDUH (Grade 1B). We recommend that patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty, or HFS receive thromboprophylaxis for at least 10 days (Grade 1A). We recommend that all trauma patients with at least one risk factor for VTE receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A). In acutely ill medical patients who have been admitted to the hospital with congestive heart failure or severe respiratory disease, or who are confined to bed and have one or more additional risk factors, we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH (Grade 1A) or LMWH (Grade 1A). We recommend, on admission to the intensive care unit, all patients be assessed for their risk of VTE. Accordingly, most patients should receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A).
10537433	We reviewed the literature on the efficacy and effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy and examined the economic consequences of under-utilisation. Despite the literature documenting the value of beta-blockers, the therapy is not prescribed at the appropriate rates. Approximately half of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) survivors who are eligible for the therapy do not receive it. There are 3 sources of costs that may arise from such under-utilisation: (i) increased morbidity and mortality associated with under-use; (ii) increased demand for related medical resources when the health state following an AMI is suboptimal due to under-use of beta-blocker therapy; and (iii) increased cost due to substitution of higher cost and/or less effective treatments for beta-blockers. For the first category, there is evidence suggesting that around 2900 to 5000 lives are lost in the US in the first year following an AMI due to underprescription. There is very little evidence on the second category of costs; 1 recent study does address this issue and indicates that beta-blocker therapy can lead to a 22% relative risk reduction for hospital readmission during the first year. Several studies also show a decrease in reinfarction. There is no information that addresses the third category of costs adequately (though 1 study does present evidence of substitution of calcium channel-blockers for beta-blockers). We conclude that there is a dearth of evidence on the economic consequences of the under-utilisation of beta-blocker therapy. What does exist suggests that the net costs to society may be substantial.
16831993	Available studies show convincingly the health benefits of lifestyle changes in CAD patients. Effect estimates of combined dietary changes look promising. Future studies should confirm these findings and assess the contribution of the individual dietary factors.
24352759	Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.
15377699	The frequency of orthostatic hypotension (OH) in cohorts of patients recruited through hospital Parkinson's disease (PD) clinics ranges from 16% to 58%. However, hospital based cohorts may be subject to ascertainment bias. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of OH in a community based population of PD patients and to determine the demographic features of patients with and without OH. Forty two (47%) of patients met the criteria for OH. Subjects with OH were older than those without OH, but there was no difference in PD disease duration or severity, MMSE or depression rating between the groups.
12629138	Admission hyperglycemia has been associated with increased hospital mortality in critically ill patients; however, it is not known whether hyperglycemia in patients admitted to general hospital wards is associated with poor outcome. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of in-hospital hyperglycemia and determine the survival and functional outcome of patients with hyperglycemia with and without a history of diabetes. We reviewed the medical records of 2030 consecutive adult patients admitted to Georgia Baptist Medical Center, a community teaching hospital in downtown Atlanta, GA, from July 1, 1998, to October 20, 1998. New hyperglycemia was defined as an admission or in-hospital fasting glucose level of 126 mg/dl (7 mmol/liter) or more or a random blood glucose level of 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/liter) or more on 2 or more determinations. Hyperglycemia was present in 38% of patients admitted to the hospital, of whom 26% had a known history of diabetes, and 12% had no history of diabetes before the admission. Newly discovered hyperglycemia was associated with higher in-hospital mortality rate (16%) compared with those patients with a prior history of diabetes (3%) and subjects with normoglycemia (1.7%; both P < 0.01). In addition, new hyperglycemic patients had a longer length of hospital stay, a higher admission rate to an intensive care unit, and were less likely to be discharged to home, frequently requiring transfer to a transitional care unit or nursing home facility. Our results indicate that in-hospital hyperglycemia is a common finding and represents an important marker of poor clinical outcome and mortality in patients with and without a history of diabetes. Patients with newly diagnosed hyperglycemia had a significantly higher mortality rate and a lower functional outcome than patients with a known history of diabetes or normoglycemia.
21187257	Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome characterized by high mortality, frequent hospitalization, reduced quality of life, and a complex therapeutic regimen. Knowledge about HF is accumulating so rapidly that individual clinicians may be unable to readily and adequately synthesize new information into effective strategies of care for patients with this syndrome. Trial data, though valuable, often do not give direction for individual patient management. These characteristics make HF an ideal candidate for practice guidelines. The 2010 Heart Failure Society of America comprehensive practice guideline addresses the full range of evaluation, care, and management of patients with HF.
17593914	As an initial management strategy in patients with stable coronary artery disease, PCI did not reduce the risk of death, myocardial infarction, or other major cardiovascular events when added to optimal medical therapy. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00007657 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).

16488379	The clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease rests on the identification of the characteristics related to dopamine deficiency that are a consequence of degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta. However, non-dopaminergic and non-motor symptoms are sometimes present before diagnosis and almost inevitably emerge with disease progression. Indeed, non-motor symptoms dominate the clinical picture of advanced Parkinson's disease and contribute to severe disability, impaired quality of life, and shortened life expectancy. By contrast with the dopaminergic symptoms of the disease, for which treatment is available, non-motor symptoms are often poorly recognised and inadequately treated. However, attention is now being focused on the recognition and quantitation of non-motor symptoms, which will form the basis of improved treatments. Some non-motor symptoms, including depression, constipation, pain, genitourinary problems, and sleep disorders, can be improved with available treatments. Other non-motor symptoms can be more refractory and need the introduction of novel non-dopaminergic drugs. Inevitably, the development of treatments that can slow or prevent the progression of Parkinson's disease and its multicentric neurodegeneration provides the best hope of curing non-motor symptoms.
17165018	Until recently, more than 30 different definitions of acute renal failure (ARF) had been used in the literature. This lack of a common reference point created confusion and made comparisons difficult. It also led to strong advocacy of a consensus definition. In response to the need for a common definition and classification of ARF, the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) group of experts developed and published a consensus definition of ARF. This definition goes under the acronym of RIFLE to indicate that it classifies patients with renal dysfunction according to the degree of impairment into patients at risk (R), with injury (I), with failure (F), with sustained loss (L) and with end-stage (E) status in relation to their renal function. This editorial aims to summarize and interpret recent findings concerning the application of the RIFLE criteria to the assessment of the epidemiology and the prediction of the outcome of ARF.
11434415	This article reviews cultural variations in the clinical presentation of depression and anxiety. Culture-specific symptoms may lead to underrecognition or misidentification of psychological distress. Contrary to the claim that non-Westerners are prone to somatize their distress, recent research confirms that somatization is ubiquitous. Somatic symptoms serve as cultural idioms of distress in many ethnocultural groups and, if misinterpreted by the clinician, may lead to unnecessary diagnostic procedures or inappropriate treatment. Clinicians must learn to decode the meaning of somatic and dissociative symptoms, which are not simply indices of disease or disorder but part of a language of distress with interpersonal and wider social meanings. Implications of these findings for the recognition and treatment of depressive disorders among culturally diverse populations in primary care and mental health settings are discussed.
14630453	Candesartan was generally well tolerated and reduced cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure and intolerance to ACE inhibitors.
15122852	Among patients with stable coronary heart disease without apparent heart failure, perindopril can significantly improve outcome. About 50 patients need to be treated for a period of 4 years to prevent one major cardiovascular event. Treatment with perindopril, on top of other preventive medications, should be considered in all patients with coronary heart disease.
1742002	A total of 503 consecutive cases of suspected stroke were examined for potential eligibility based on recent development of a paralyzed limb. Of 123 otherwise eligible subjects, 22 were found by ultrasound to have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on admission. Therefore, 101 patients were assigned randomly to one of the treatment groups or to the control group. The three treatments were adjusted-dose heparin, external pneumatic compression and functional electrical muscle stimulation. An ultrasound examination of the lower extremities was conducted twice a week on each patient until completion of the study (28 days or discharge, whichever came first). Electrical muscle stimulation was discontinued after 4 mo of the study because of discomfort, blister formation and high drop-out rate. Ten patients developed DVT during the study period. In 17 of the 32 cases of DVT, venography was performed, which confirmed the ultrasound findings in every case. The 32 cases of DVT differed from those without DVT by having a higher prevalence of hypertension (P = 0.02), cholesterol (P = 0.08) and a longer time interval between stroke and admission (P less than 0.05). We conclude that ultrasound is effective for DVT detection in the rehabilitation setting, and two-thirds of such cases are detectable on admission.
12100768	Multiple, practical questionnaires with reasonable performance characteristics are available to help clinicians identify and diagnose patients with major depression. Diagnostic confirmation by mental health care professionals using a clinical interview or by primary care physicians using a semistructured interview can be made with high reliability.
1596053	Patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk (greater than 7% per year) and low risk (less than 3% per year) for thromboembolism can be identified by readily available clinical variables.
2858114	Long-term beta blockade for perhaps a year or so following discharge after an MI is now of proven value, and for many such patients mortality reductions of about 25% can be achieved. No important differences are clearly apparent among the benefits of different beta blockers, although some are more convenient than others (or have slightly fewer side effects), and it appears that those with appreciable intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may confer less benefit. If monitored, the side effects of long-term therapy are not a major problem, as when they occur they are easily reversible by changing the beta blocker or by discontinuation of treatment. By contrast, although very early IV short-term beta blockade can definitely limit infarct size, more reliable information about the effects of such treatment on mortality will not be available until a large trial (ISIS) reports later this year, with data on some thousands of patients entered within less than 4 hours of the onset of pain. Our aim has been not only to review the 65-odd randomized beta blocker trials but also to demonstrate that when many randomized trials have all applied one general approach to treatment, it is often not appropriate to base inference on individual trial results. Although there will usually be important differences from one trial to another (in eligibility, treatment, end-point assessment, and so on), physicians who wish to decide whether to adopt a particular treatment policy should try to make their decision in the light of an overview of all these related randomized trials and not just a few particular trial results. Although most trials are too small to be individually reliable, this defect of size may be rectified by an overview of many trials, as long as appropriate statistical methods are used. Fortunately, robust statistical methods exist--based on direct, unweighted summation of one O-E value from each trial--that are simple for physicians to use and understand yet provide full statistical sensitivity. These methods allow combination of information from different trials while avoiding the unjustified direct comparison of patients in one trial with patients in another. (Moreover, they can be extended of such data that there is no real need for the introduction of any more complex statistical methods that might be more difficult for physicians to trust.) Their robustness, sensitivity, and avoidance of unnecessary complexity make these particular methods an important tool in trial overviews.
18671796	VADT is maintaining the expected A1C in both STD and INT, and LDL-C, triglycerides and blood pressure are at target. The trial is continuing to June 2008. It will be the first long-term completed type 2 diabetes study of the role of glycaemia on CV disease with modern treatments.
16290952	Depressive disorders are common in patients with ischemic heart disease and have serious consequences in terms of the risk of further cardiac events and cardiac mortality. Among survivors of acute myocardial infarction, up to one fifth meet diagnostic criteria for major depression, and the presence of major depression carries a >5-fold increased risk for cardiac mortality within 6 months. This article reviews clinical trial data on the cardiac safety profiles of antidepressant agents with the aim of discussing clinical considerations in selecting the most appropriate treatment of comorbid depression in patients with ischemic heart disease. Tricyclic antidepressants are effective against depression but are associated with cardiovascular side effects including orthostatic hypotension, slowed cardiac conduction, antiarrhythmic activity, and increased heart rate. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, by contrast, have benign cardiovascular profiles and are well tolerated in patients with cardiac disease. The safety of dual-acting serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors has not been well studied. Intervention with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has the potential to provide the depressed patient with ischemic heart disease relief from their depressive symptoms and may offer a potential improvement in their cardiovascular risk profile.
18310670	Primary PCI is now used much more than fibrinolysis. Although hospital mortality and delays to fibrinolytic reperfusion have improved, over 40% of patients reperfused still receive it outside the time window recommended, and one-third of potentially eligible patients receive no reperfusion.

8091441	Diabetes influences stroke in several aspects: in age, in subtype, in speed of recovery, and in mortality. Increased glucose levels on admission independently increase mortality from stroke in nondiabetic but not in diabetic patients. The effect of reducing high admission glucose levels in nondiabetic stroke patients should be examined in future trials.
21918495	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) causes one in three (approximately 800,000) deaths reported each year in the United States. Annual direct and overall costs resulting from CVD are estimated at $273 billion and $444 billion, respectively. Strategies that address leading CVD risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol levels, and smoking, can greatly reduce the burden of CVD. To estimate the U.S. prevalence of these three risk factors, CDC analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) on uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and current smoking. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which found that 49.7% of U.S. adults aged 20 years (an estimated 107.3 million persons) have at least one of the three risk factors. To reduce the prevalence of CVD risk factors among persons in the United States, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with nonprofit and private organizations, is launching Million Hearts, a multifaceted combination of evidence-based interventions and strategies aimed at preventing 1 million heart attacks and strokes over the next 5 years.
11546898	Highly rated and agreed on performance measures exist in all domains of hospital-based stroke care.
1951474	The long-term effects of converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers on proteinuria and the progression of renal disease in patients with hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency are not well established. We have studied the long-term effects of treating hypertension with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, and a calcium channel blocker, nicardipine, on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and on renal function in 16 patients with hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance ranging between 17 and 62 ml/min). After 1 year of treatment, these agents caused a similar decrease in blood pressure. Only enalapril, however, caused a significant decrease in UAE (from 641 +/- 98 to 292 +/- 47 mg/24 h, p less than 0.01), whereas UAE did not change in the group treated with nicardipine (675 +/- 78 vs. 601 +/- 75 mg/24 h). Creatinine clearance at the beginning of the study was similar in the group treated with enalapril and in the group treated with nicardipine (35 +/- 3.6 vs. 40 +/- 4.1 ml/min). After 1 year of follow-up, creatinine clearance remained unchanged in both groups of patients. These studies demonstrate that both enalapril and nicardipine can effectively reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency. Enalapril but not nicardipine, however, appears to reduce urinary albumin excretion in these patients. Whether the reduction in UAE has any significant impact on the progression of renal disease remains to be established.
10737280	Hospital or nursing home confinement, surgery, trauma, malignant neoplasm, chemotherapy, neurologic disease with paresis, central venous catheter or pacemaker, varicose veins, and superficial vein thrombosis are independent and important risk factors for VTE.
22733929	The frequency of referral to colonoscopy based on a polyp size threshold of 6 mm was 14.5%. Colorectal neoplasia was found in 9.3% of patients, with advanced neoplasia in 3.3%. Potentially important extracolonic findings were observed in 2.9% of patients. The low rates of referral to colonoscopy, prevalence of advanced neoplasia, and prevalence of extracolonic findings make CTC a viable option for Medicare-aged patients.
11274933	Despite scientific evidence that secondary prevention medical therapies reduce mortality in patients with established coronary artery disease, these therapies continue to be underutilized in patients receiving conventional care. To address this issue, a Cardiac Hospital Atherosclerosis Management Program (CHAMP) focused on initiation of aspirin, cholesterol-lowering medication (hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A [HMG CoA] reductase inhibitor titrated to achieve low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol < or =100 mg/dl), beta blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in conjunction with diet and exercise counseling before hospital discharge in patients with established coronary artery disease. Treatment rates and clinical outcome were compared in patients discharged after myocardial infarction in the 2-year period before (1992 to 1993) and the 2-year period after (1994 to 1995) CHAMP was implemented. In the pre- and post-CHAMP patient groups, aspirin use at discharge improved from 68% to 92% (p <0.01), beta blocker use improved from 12% to 62% (p <0.01), ACE inhibitor use increased from 6% to 58% (p <0.01), and statin use increased from 6% to 86% (p <0.01). This increased use of treatment persisted during subsequent follow-up. There was also a significant increase in patients achieving a LDL cholesterol < or =100 mg/dl (6% vs 58%, p <0.001) and a reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction and 1-year mortality. Compared with conventional guidelines and care, CHAMP was associated with a significant increase in use of medications that have been previously demonstrated to reduce mortality; more patients achieved an LDL cholesterol < or =100 mg/dl, and there were improved clinical outcomes in patients after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction.
15920136	Although the survival benefits of ACE inhibitors for patients with diabetic nephropathy are known, the relative effects of ACE inhibitors and AIIRAs on survival are unknown owing to the lack of adequate head to head trials.
17785639	In this multinational observational study, improvements in the management of patients with ACS were associated with significant reductions in the rates of new heart failure and mortality and in rates of stroke and mycoardial infarction at 6 months.
21343193	The risk associated with a specific risk stratification score depended on the risk factors composing the score. CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc performed better than CHADS(2) in predicting patients at high risk, and those categorised as low risk by CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc were truly at low risk for thromboembolism.
15096459	These results suggest that every minute of delay in primary angioplasty for STEMI affects 1-year mortality, even after adjustment for baseline characteristics. Therefore, all efforts should be made to shorten the total ischemic time, not only for thrombolytic therapy but also for primary angioplasty.
18805849	The 1985 release of hospital report cards by the Health Care Financing Administration awakened the public's awareness of variations in outcomes following patient treatment. In 1972, the Department of Veterans Affairs initiated an oversight process for all VA-based cardiac surgery programs. In response to Public Law 99-166, the Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program (CICSP) national database was developed in 1987. This CICSP effort reported variations in outcomes across VA cardiac programs. In 1997, the CICSP expanded (CICSP-X) to identify the interrelationships of risk factors with processes and structures of care, as well as clinical outcomes. Based on VA findings to date, these quality improvement endeavors appear to have positively affected short-term and longer-term cardiac surgical outcomes. To advance a new patient-focused paradigm for continuous improvement in cardiac surgical care quality for all US citizens, an integrated data-driven reporting approach with broad-based participation should be implemented to optimally improve patient care.
9194273	This paper considers an index of hospital quality performance defined as the ratio of the observed number deaths to the number predicted by a fitted logistic regression model. We study tests and confidence intervals under two different scenarios depending on the availability of an estimate of the covariance matrix of the coefficients from the fitted logistic regression model. We propose parametric as well as bootstrap-based confidence intervals. We apply the methods to an analysis of the performance of 27 intensive care units.
3398199	Randomized clinical trials of cardiac rehabilitation following myocardial infarction have typically demonstrated a lower mortality in treated patients, but with a statistically significant reduction in only one trial. To overcome the problem of not being able to detect small but clinically important benefits in mortality in randomized clinical trials of exercise and risk factor rehabilitation after myocardial infarction with small numbers of patients, we carried out a meta-analysis on the combined results of ten randomized clinical trials that included 4347 patients (control, 2145 patients; rehabilitation, 2202 patients). The pooled odds ratios of 0.76 (95% confidence intervals, 0.63 to 0.92) for all-cause death and of 0.75 (95% confidence intervals, 0.62 to 0.93) for cardiovascular death were significantly lower in the rehabilitation group than in the control group, with no significant difference for nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction. These results suggest that, for appropriately selected patients, comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation has a beneficial effect on mortality but not on nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction.
16627072	This report highlights for the first time the aggregated risk reduction from all published randomized controlled trials, and shows the protection of perioperative beta blockade against both short-term complications and mortality.
18563622	Besides the sub-optimal prescribing of secondary prevention drugs, absence of continuity of prescribing seems to be a challenging issue in pharmaceutical care of coronary artery disease patients.
10331339	Preoperative preparation of the cardiac patient is based on matching the cardiac reserve to the blood flow demands imposed by surgical stress and the underlying disease state. Evaluation must include functional assessment of any coronary artery disease or other organic cardiac disease that may place myocardial tissue at risk of ischemia as demand for cardiac output increases. Monitoring should be individualized based on anticipated problems and the risk assessment of the patient. Preoperative therapy should include maneuvers that reduce congestive heart failure, optimize volume status, and provide adequate cardiac output to deliver oxygen sufficient to meet or exceed demand. Underlying electrical and metabolic abnormalities should be corrected and controlled in the perioperative period. Long-term therapy should be evaluated and modified in the context of the anesthetic and surgical plan. Preventive interventions such as fluid loading and low-dose dopamine should be considered prior to surgery.
20614425	Analysis of these RCT's confirm that GCS are effective in diminishing the risk of DVT in hospitalised patients. Data examination also suggests, that GCS on a background of another method of prophylaxis is even more effective than GCS alone.

20118455	People with schizophrenia have a mortality risk that is two to three times that of the general population. Most of the extra deaths are from natural causes. The apparent increase in cardiovascular mortality relative to the general population should be of concern to anyone with an interest in mental health.
10437857	In non-diabetic nephropathies, ACE inhibition confers renoprotection even to patients with non-nephrotic proteinuria.
10825765	Little research exists on the outcome of smaller patients who undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of cardiac surgery in smaller patients (males with body surface area of 1.6 square meters or less, and women with 1.5 meters or less). A consecutive series of 4,358 patients undergoing bypass surgery was evaluated. Of these, 246 (5.6%) were classified as small patients. Smaller patients were more likely to be women, older and of Asian ethnicity. They were less likely to have undergone a prior cardiac surgery. Smaller patients were less likely to receive an arterial conduit (74% versus 99%; p<0.00001). Rates of post-surgery complications differed between small and normal size patients, with smaller patients more likely to require prolonged ventilator support (p <0.05), more likely to have acute renal failure (p<0.0001), more transfusions and re-operation for bleeding (p<0.05), higher death rate (5.7% versus 2.6%; p<0.01) and longer length of hospital stay (11.4 versus 8.3 days; p<0.00001). In multivariate analyses evaluating factors related to death, emergent surgery, poor ejection fraction and older patient age were independently related to mortality. Small body surface area was not an independent predictor. The results of this study indicate that smaller patients do have poorer outcomes associated with coronary artery bypass surgery. However, 90% of the smaller patients did have an event-free surgery. Surgeons may need to monitor these patients more closely and anticipate the increased risk and cost that is associated with this group.
18382186	AKI has a high incidence, comparable with acute lung injury and severe sepsis, and is associated with higher hospital mortality.
2406522	The symptoms of angina pectoris reflect transient inadequacy of myocardial oxygen supply as a consequence of decreased myocardial blood flow, increased myocardial oxygen demand, or both. The prognosis for patients with angina depends on the extent and severity of coronary artery disease, on left ventricular systolic function, and on the presence and severity of ischemia on exercise testing. The characteristics of angina may be variable, but certain clinical patterns are consistent and are helpful for diagnosis. Angina must be distinguished from various noncardiovascular and cardiovascular conditions; in most cases, the differences can be established by careful clinical assessment.
7611156	Despite the limitations of our study, we believe the current data support the beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation and exercise training in the elderly, including modest improvements in lipids, obesity indexes, behavioral characteristics, and quality-of-life parameters, and marked improvements in exercise capacity. In fact, elderly patients had greater improvements than younger patients in both exercise capacity and mental health after cardiac rehabilitation. These data indicate that elderly patients with CAD should be routinely referred to and vigorously encouraged to pursue formal outpatient cardiac rehabilitation and exercise training programs after major CAD events.
10796301	Low molecular weight heparin or heparinoid appear to decrease the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis compared to standard unfractionated heparin, but there are too few data to provide reliable information on their effect on other important outcomes, including death and intracranial haemorrhage.
10821355	Overall 12,763 patients were randomly assigned treatment or placebo and followed up for an average of 35 months. In the three post-infarction trials (n=5,966), mortality was lower with ACE inhibitors than with placebo (702/2995 [23.4%] vs 866/2971 [29.1%]; odds ratio 0.74 [95% CI 0.66-0-83]), as were the rates of readmission for heart failure (355 [11.9%] vs 460 [15.5%]; 0.73 [0.63-0.85]), reinfarction (324 [10.8%] vs 391 [13.2%]; 0.80 [0.69-0.94]), or the composite of these events (1049 [35.0%] vs 1244 [41.9%]; 0.75 [0.67-0.83]; all p<O.001). For all five trials the ACE inhibitor group had lower rates of death than the placebo group (1,467/6,391 [23.0%] vs 1,710/6,372 [26.8%]; 0.80 [0.74-0.87]) and lower rates of reinfarction (571 [8.9%] vs 703 [11.0%]; 0.79 [0.70-0.89]), readmission for heart failure (876 [13.7%] vs 1202 [18.9%]; 0.67 [0.61-0.74]), and the composite of these events (2161 [33.8%] vs 2610 [41.0%]; 0.72 [0.67-0.78]; all p<0.0001). The benefits were observed early after the start of therapy and persisted long term. The benefits of treatment on all outcomes were independent of age, sex, and baseline use of diuretics, aspirin, and beta-blockers. Although there was a trend towards greater reduction in risk of death or readmission for heart failure in patients with lower ejection fractions, benefit was apparent over the range examined.
15168957	Depression in elderly persons is widespread, often undiagnosed, and usually untreated. The current system of care is fragmented and inadequate, and staff at residential and other facilities often are ill-equipped to recognize and treat patients with depression. Because there is no reliable diagnostic test, a careful clinical evaluation is essential. Depressive illness in later life should be treated with antidepressants that are appropriate for use in geriatric patients. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach, including consideration of electroconvulsive treatment in some cases, is important. The overall long-term prognosis for elderly depressed patients is good.
15548476	There were significant variations in the pathways of care for stroke across European centres in the mid 1990s, which were associated with variation in outcome, and remain unexplained. Family support is more prevalent in southern Europe and service support more prevalent in the UK.
19362752	We identified only 4 swallowing screening protocols for patients with acute stroke that met basic criteria. Cost-effectiveness of screening, including costs associated with false-positive results and impact of screening on morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay, requires elucidation.

10755896	Bisoprolol reduces the perioperative incidence of death from cardiac causes and nonfatal myocardial infarction in high-risk patients who are undergoing major vascular surgery.
14500855	The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts in the field of vascular ultrasonography (US) to come to a consensus regarding Doppler US for assistance in the diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis. The panel's consensus statement is believed to represent a reasonable position on the basis of analysis of available literature and panelists' experience. Key elements of the statement include the following: (a) All internal carotid artery (ICA) examinations should be performed with gray-scale, color Doppler, and spectral Doppler US. (b) The degree of stenosis determined at gray-scale and Doppler US should be stratified into the categories of normal (no stenosis), <50% stenosis, 50%-69% stenosis, > or =70% stenosis to near occlusion, near occlusion, and total occlusion. (c) ICA peak systolic velocity (PSV) and presence of plaque on gray-scale and/or color Doppler images are primarily used in diagnosis and grading of ICA stenosis; two additional parameters, ICA-to-common carotid artery PSV ratio and ICA end-diastolic velocity may also be used when clinical or technical factors raise concern that ICA PSV may not be representative of the extent of disease. (d) ICA should be diagnosed as (i) normal when ICA PSV is less than 125 cm/sec and no plaque or intimal thickening is visible; (ii) <50% stenosis when ICA PSV is less than 125 cm/sec and plaque or intimal thickening is visible; (iii) 50%-69% stenosis when ICA PSV is 125-230 cm/sec and plaque is visible; (iv) > or =70% stenosis to near occlusion when ICA PSV is greater than 230 cm/sec and visible plaque and lumen narrowing are seen; (v) near occlusion when there is a markedly narrowed lumen at color Doppler US; and (vi) total occlusion when there is no detectable patent lumen at gray-scale US and no flow at spectral, power, and color Doppler US. (e) The final report should discuss velocity measurements and gray-scale and color Doppler findings. Study limitations should be noted when they exist. The conclusion should state an estimated degree of ICA stenosis as reflected in the above categories. The panel also considered various technical aspects of carotid US and methods for quality assessment and identified several important unanswered questions meriting future research.
21029359	Current published risk schemes have modest predictive value for stroke. A new scheme (CHA(2) DS(2) -VASc) may discriminate those at truly low risk and minimize classification of subjects as intermediate/moderate risk. This approach would simplify our approach to stroke risk stratification and improve decision-making for thromboprophylaxis in patients with AF.

16331166	The results provide a contemporary picture of neurosurgical surgical approaches to the management of head injured patients with an intradural mass lesion and/or signs of raised intracranial pressure in some Neurosurgical Units across the world. The relative benefits of early versus delayed surgery in patients with intraparenchymal lesions and on the indications, technique and benefits of decompressive craniectomy could be topics for future head injury research.
12651987	This quantitative review suggests that depressive symptoms contribute a significant independent risk for the onset of coronary disease, a risk (1.64) that is greater than the risk conferred by passive smoking (1.25) but less than the risk conferred by active smoking (2.5). Future prospective community studies should examine the effect of severity and duration of depressive symptoms and disorders on the risk for the onset of coronary disease.
2883575	To evaluate the influence of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril (2.5 to 40 mg per day) on the prognosis of severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class IV), we randomly assigned 253 patients in a double-blind study to receive either placebo (n = 126) or enalapril (n = 127). Conventional treatment for heart failure, including the use of other vasodilators, was continued in both groups. Follow-up averaged 188 days (range, 1 day to 20 months). The crude mortality at the end of six months (primary end point) was 26 percent in the enalapril group and 44 percent in the placebo group--a reduction of 40 percent (P = 0.002). Mortality was reduced by 31 percent at one year (P = 0.001). By the end of the study, there had been 68 deaths in the placebo group and 50 in the enalapril group--a reduction of 27 percent (P = 0.003). The entire reduction in total mortality was found to be among patients with progressive heart failure (a reduction of 50 percent), whereas no difference was seen in the incidence of sudden cardiac death. A significant improvement in NYHA classification was observed in the enalapril group, together with a reduction in heart size and a reduced requirement for other medication for heart failure. The overall withdrawal rate was similar in both groups, but hypotension requiring withdrawal occurred in seven patients in the enalapril group and in no patients in the placebo group. After the initial dose of enalapril was reduced to 2.5 mg daily in high-risk patients, this side effect was less frequent. We conclude that the addition of enalapril to conventional therapy in patients with severe congestive heart failure can reduce mortality and improve symptoms. The beneficial effect on mortality is due to a reduction in death from the progression of heart failure.

19808277	These data are among the first to assess treatment in the outpatient setting since the release of the latest national HF guidelines and to demonstrate substantial variation among cardiology practices in the documented therapies provided to HF patients.
15068994	The weight-based heparin nomogram is widely generalizable and has proved to be effective, safe, and superior to one based on standard practice.
22972067	Conventional cooling methods to induce mild therapeutic hypothermia seem to improve survival and neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest. Our review supports the current best medical practice as recommended by the International Resuscitation Guidelines.
21098779	Risk-adjusted TTR can be used to profile the quality of outpatient oral anticoagulation in a large, integrated health system. This measure can serve as the basis for quality measurement and quality improvement efforts.
18539218	A large proportion of hospitalised patients are at risk for VTE, but there is a low rate of appropriate prophylaxis. Our data reinforce the rationale for the use of hospital-wide strategies to assess patients' VTE risk and to implement measures that ensure that at-risk patients receive appropriate prophylaxis.
20489174	Stroke quality improvement is still in its early stages, but data suggest that large-scale improvements in stroke care can result from the implementation of stroke performance measures. Performance measures that address multidisciplinary stroke unit care, outpatient-based care, and patient-oriented outcomes such as functional recovery should be considered. Ongoing challenges relevant to stroke quality improvement include the role of public reporting and the need to link better stroke care to improved patient outcomes.
8269101	The relationship between a hypercoagulable state and intracardiac thrombus formation is reviewed, with reference to the pathophysiology of intracardiac thrombus in patients with acute cardioembolic stroke, and those with mitral stenosis. When the development or enlargement of intracardiac thrombus is followed serially by echocardiography, the diameter of the inferior vena cava is seen to decrease as the hematocrit increases, particularly in patients with negative water balance taking diuretics. These findings strongly suggest that dehydration could play an important role in the formation of thrombus. A hypercoagulable and secondarily enhanced fibrinolytic state exists in the cardiac chamber of patients with acute cardioembolic stroke or with intracardiac thrombus. This can be evaluated by plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A, fibrinopeptide B beta 15-42, thrombin-antithrombin III complex and D-dimer. Anticoagulant treatment suppresses thrombin activity in the cardiac chamber, allowing plasma fibrinolytic activity to predominate and reduce the size of the intracardiac thrombus.
1892330	Prophylaxis for venous thromboemobolism is underused, particularly in nonteaching hospitals.
21734636	Continued declines in incidence and mortality are expected as past and current public health emphasis on the importance of CRC screening become evident with the increase in screening. To ensure these gains continue, CRC screening should be accessible and used as recommended by all eligible persons in the United States.
12021694	Prophylactic CS and Ed in patients with prior venous stasis ulceration are cost saving, even with the most conservative of assumptions. Insurers should routinely reimburse for these interventions.
20947855	Planned collaborations between stroke researchers to conduct trials with common protocols and outcome measures can help advance rehabilitation science. VEM was associated with improved independence at 3 months compared with standard care. However, both trials are limited by small sample sizes. Larger trials (such as AVERT phase III) are still needed in this field.
19033164	Depression and anxiety were strongly associated with common chronic medical disorders and adverse health behaviors. Examination of mental health should therefore be an integral component of overall health care.
14674380	Our results suggest that carvedilol extends survival compared with metoprolol.
17872477	Management of patients with acute ischemic stroke remains multifaceted and includes several aspects of care that have not been tested in clinical trials. This statement includes recommendations for management from the first contact by emergency medical services personnel through initial admission to the hospital. Intravenous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator remains the most beneficial proven intervention for emergency treatment of stroke. Several interventions, including intra-arterial administration of thrombolytic agents and mechanical interventions, show promise. Because many of the recommendations are based on limited data, additional research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke is needed.
23032469	Strong recommendations apply to most patients, whereas weak recommendations are sensitive to differences among patients, including their preferences.
15266423	All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50-70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.
3052345	Favored strategies for diagnosis of first DVT combine use of pretest probability assessment, D-dimer, and US. There is lower-quality evidence available to guide diagnosis of recurrent DVT, upper extremity DVT, and DVT during pregnancy.
15121495	After myocardial infarction, a large proportion of patients discontinue use of medications over time. Enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction is associated with improved medication adherence.
18216632	We identified numerous issues related to study design, conduct, and quality that dispute the validity and question any inferences that can be drawn from these trials. In the context of these limitations, the initial RRT modality did not seem to affect mortality or recovery to RRT independence. There is urgent need for additional high-quality and suitably powered trials to adequately address this issue.
23011717	Increases in TKA volume have been driven by both increases in the number of Medicare enrollees and in per capita utilization. We also observed decreases in hospital LOS that were accompanied by increases in hospital readmission rates.
19896240	These recommendations are designed to be of assistance to doctors in ICUs when making first evaluations of these patients. They are mainly intended to assist with early diagnosis, risk stratification and initial treatment. The need for individualised treatment is at present one of the main objectives in the management of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), with or without ST elevation, and this is why we believe the recommendations should be of a predominantly practical nature, given that they affect decision making in the day to day practice of medicine.
17765050	In patients following major coronary events, cardiac rehabilitation is associated with both reductions in depressive symptoms and the excess mortality associated with it. Moreover, only mild improvements in levels of fitness appear to be needed to produce these benefits on depressive symptoms and its associated mortality.
11742929	One of six cases of all VTE and two of three cases of VTE for which thromboprophylaxis had been indicated could potentially have been prevented had physicians followed the recommended ACCP guidelines. Inadequacy of prophylaxis was most often caused by omission of prophylaxis. Missed opportunities for prevention occurred most commonly in the settings of nonorthopedic surgery, pneumonia, and stroke.
15381522	Pending confirmation from large, ongoing clinical trials, this analysis shows that observational studies are consistent with limited clinical trial data and suggests that chronic hyperglycemia is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease in persons with diabetes.
12028227	Our meta-analysis indicates that reduction in LDL-C associated with statin drug treatment decreases the risk of coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality. The risk reduction was similar for men and women and for elderly and middle-aged persons.
8408712	Computer based programs can assist outpatient anticoagulant control with warfarin during both early and long term treatment. For most patients the control achieved is as good as that obtained by the customary method of dosing, by experienced clinic doctors, although the latter tend to be too conservative when dosing patients within the intense target range of 3.0 to 4.5 International Normalised Ratio (INR). The computers were significantly more successful in this higher range.
17906263	People with severe mental illness treated with antipsychotics have excess metabolic dysfunction and heightened risk for cardiovascular disease.
19170587	Thromboembolic disorders such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke often result in long-term disability and/or mortality. The anticoagulants currently available have been effective in the treatment and prevention of these disorders; however, parenteral administration, variable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, drug and dietary interactions, and a requirement for frequent monitoring of efficacy and safety limit use of these drugs. Rivaroxaban is a novel, oral factor Xa inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic diseases. Rivaroxaban is a small molecule directed at active sites, and the agent mechanistically differs from traditional anticoagulants, such as heparins and fondaparinux, in that its activity is independent of antithrombin and its ability to inhibit prothrombinase bound factor Xa. In addition, preclinical and clinical trial data indicate that rivaroxaban has predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, which are features that differentiate it from oral vitamin K antagonists. Phase II studies showed that rivaroxaban is safe and well tolerated across a wide range of doses. Furthermore, completed phase III studies demonstrated its efficacy in the prevention of venous thromboembolism after orthopedic surgery. Additional studies are now under way to evaluate the use of rivaroxaban in the treatment and prevention of other venous and arterial thromboembolic conditions.
11213249	Stroke is a common problem, producing a variety of neurological problems that affect eating. Dysphagia is a particular concern because of its potential for airway obstruction, malnutrition, and aspiration pneumonia. With chest infection reported in up to 32% of stroke patients, this is a major clinical issue. The following research questions are raised: (1) What are the incidence and outcomes of dysphagia and aspiration in acute stroke? (2) What screening interventions are available to detect dysphagia in patients with acute stroke and what effect have they on patient outcomes? A systematic review was carried out using methods and quality criteria of the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (1996), focusing on studies of adults with acute stroke. Data were extracted, collated, and presented descriptively. Two hundred forty-eight articles were retrieved with 26 meeting inclusion and quality criteria. Clinical dysphagia is common, associated with a range of deleterious outcomes and clearly linked to development of chest infection. Interpretation of aspiration on videofluoroscopy is not as straightforward but probably also confers additional risk. Further work is required on the relationship between aspiration and pneumonia, and pneumonia prevention. This will include exploration of the effects of screening, and the further development and validation of screening methods. While studies indicate current "best practice," in this important area of patient care further work is urgently required.

14596714	OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to assess the prevalence and persistence of symptoms of depression and anxiety during the first 12 months following acute myocardial infarction (MI). DESIGN AND METHODS: In a prospective study, 288 MI patients were assessed for symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) in hospital, 2-15 days following MI, and 4 and 12 months subsequently. RESULTS: During hospitalization, 89 (30.9%) and 75 (26.1%) patients registered elevated BDI scores (>/=10) and state anxiety scores (>/=40), respectively. The 4 and 12 month prevalence rates were 37.7% and 37.2% for depressive symptoms, and 41.8% and 40.0% for anxious symptoms, respectively. Depression and anxiety were highly co-morbid, with 51% of patients experiencing significant levels of depressive and anxious symptoms at baseline. More than half the patients with complete BDI and state anxiety data experienced either elevated symptoms of anxiety or depression throughout the first year following MI. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are prevalent, persistent problems during the first year following MI. This study highlights the importance of routine psychological assessment for MI patients both in hospital and after discharge.
16585666	Heart failure is a clinical syndrome that normally requires health care to be provided by both specialists and nonspecialists. This is advantageous because patients benefit from complementary skill sets and experience, but can present challenges in the development of a common, shared treatment plan. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society published a comprehensive set of recommendations on the diagnosis and management of heart failure in January 2006, and on the prevention, management during intercurrent illness or acute decompensation, and use of biomarkers in January 2007. The present update builds on those core recommendations. Based on feedback obtained through a national program of heart failure workshops during 2006 and 2007, several topics were identified as priorities because of the challenges they pose to health care professionals. New evidence-based recommendations were developed using the structured approach for the review and assessment of evidence that was adopted and previously described by the Society. Specific recommendations and practical tips were written for best practices during the transition of care of heart failure patients, and the recognition, investigation and treatment of some specific cardiomyopathies. Specific clinical questions that are addressed include: What information should a referring physician provide for a specialist consultation? What instructions should a consultant provide to the referring physician? What processes should be in place to ensure that the expectations and needs of each physician are met? When a cardiomyopathy is suspected, how can it be recognized, how should it be investigated and diagnosed, how should it be treated, when should the patient be referred, and what special tests are available to assist in the diagnosis and treatment? The goals of the present update are to translate best evidence into practice, apply clinical wisdom where evidence for specific strategies is weaker, and aid physicians and other health care providers to optimally treat heart failure patients, resulting in a measurable impact on patient health and clinical outcomes in Canada.
19461022	There is a strong association of high systolic BP after thrombolysis with poor outcome. Withholding antihypertensive therapy up to 7 days in patients with a history of hypertension was associated with worse outcome, whereas initiation of antihypertensive therapy in newly recognized moderate hypertension was associated with a favorable outcome.
2057006	We have investigated the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in 98 individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and in a control group of 50. Seventy-nine of those with PD were being treated with dopaminergic medications and 19 were untreated. Those symptoms occurring more frequently in PD patients than in controls included abnormal salivation, dysphagia, nausea, constipation, and defecatory dysfunction. Except for defecatory dysfunction, symptoms did not correlate with treatment but instead correlated with disease severity. This suggests that the GI symptoms of PD reflect direct involvement in the GI tract by the primary disease process.
9932944	During acute ischemic stroke hyperglycemia may worsen the clinical outcome in nonlacunar stroke, but not in lacunar stroke, and is not associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct.
22187273	Depression is associated with a significantly increased risk of stroke morbidity and mortality.
15495007	Fixed dose LMWH is more effective and safer than adjusted dose UFH for the initial treatment of VTE. Compared to UFH, LMWH significantly reduced the incidence of thrombotic complications, the occurrence of major haemorrhage during initial treatment and overall mortality at follow up.
15674871	Calcium antagonists reduce the risk of poor outcome and secondary ischaemia after aneurysmal SAH. The results for 'poor outcome' depend largely on a single large trial of oral nimodipine; the evidence for other calcium antagonists is inconclusive. The evidence for nimodipine is not beyond all doubt, but given the potential benefits and modest risks of this treatment, oral nimodipine is currently indicated in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Intravenous administration of calcium antagonists cannot be recommended for routine practice on the basis of the present evidence. Magnesium sulphate is a promising agent but more evidence is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn.

10407688	Pulmonary embolism occurs in more than 175,000 patients each year in the United States. The objectives of treatment are to prevent death from the existing embolus, to prevent death and morbidity from recurrent pulmonary embolism, and to prevent morbidity from recurrent deep-vein thrombosis. For patients with adequate cardiorespiratory reserve, the primary objective is to prevent recurrent pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulant therapy with intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin followed by oral anticoagulant treatment for at least 3 months is the treatment of choice for most of these patients. Clinical trials indicate that the effectiveness of intravenous heparin depends on achieving an adequate heparin effect (activated partial thromboplastin time above lower limit) during the initial 24 hours. A validated protocol for intravenous heparin should be used to lessen the likelihood of delayed heparinization. Low molecular weight heparin given subcutaneously either once or twice daily is as effective as intravenous heparin for the treatment of patients with deep-vein thrombosis and submassive pulmonary embolism. Low molecular weight heparin enables many patients with uncomplicated deep-vein thrombosis to be treated in an outpatient setting.
12411640	Both high blood pressure and low blood pressure were independent prognostic factors for poor outcome, relationships that appear to be mediated in part by increased rates of early recurrence and death resulting from presumed cerebral edema in patients with high blood pressure and increased coronary heart disease events in those with low blood pressure. The occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 14 days was independent of SBP.
15668354	This article updates the 1994 American Heart Association scientific statement on cardiac rehabilitation.

16103248	Total door-to-balloon times for transfer patients undergoing primary PCI in the United States rarely achieve guideline-recommended benchmarks, and current decision making should take these times into account. For the full benefits of primary PCI to be realized in transfer patients, improved systems are urgently needed to minimize total door-to-balloon times.

10591390	This study found no significant rt-PA benefit on the 90-day efficacy end points in patients treated between 3 and 5 hours. The risk of symptomatic ICH increased with rt-PA treatment. These results do not support the use of intravenous rt-PA for stroke treatment beyond 3 hours.
20842753	From the caregiver perspective, lack of knowledge and low self-efficacy play a larger role than practical barriers in compliance with annual TCDs. Ongoing education at multiple patient encounters and encouragement of caregivers' empowerment and role in obtaining annual screenings may increase TCD compliance.
10089714	We investigated the effects of antihypertensive treatment on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of long-term hemodialysis patients. In uremic patients, it is still controversial in antihypertensive effect to the regression of LVH. The left ventricular size and function of 39 uremic hypertensive long-term hemodialysis patients (27 men, 12 women, mean age 58.3) was evaluated with M-mode, 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography before, and 12 months after, the start of combined antihypertensive therapy. This therapy included angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists. Patients were classified as responders or nonresponders, depending upon whether their systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased by more than 10 mmHg after antihypertensive treatment for 12 months. Before treatment, 36 (92%) patients had LVH and diastolic dysfunction and three (8%) had systolic dysfunction. At the end of 12 months, only 25 (64%) patients had LVH, 30 (77%) had diastolic dysfunction and 2 (5%) had systolic dysfunction. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) also decreased from 203.63 +/- 70.47 g/m2 to 178.57 +/- 67.31 g/m2. LVMI correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) but did not correlate with diastolic blood pressure (DBP). There were 26 responders and 13 non-responders. Among responders, both the SBP (153.91 +/- 13.24 mmHg vs 134.43 +/- 14.21 mmHg, p < 0.01) and DBP (90.39 +/- 7.89 mmHg vs 79.98 +/- 7.35 mmHg, p < 0.01) decreased significantly after antihypertensive therapy. Responders also exhibited progressive regression of LVH (LVMI decreased significantly from 208.52 +/- 72.03 g/m2 to 168.52 +/- 55.53 g/m2, p < 0.05). However, LVH regression was not found in nonresponders (LVMI showed 194.84 +/- 64.36 g/m2 vs 193.66 +/- 77.67 g/m2). We conclude that good control of blood pressure can reverse LVH in hypertensive hemodialysis patients.
19279509	It is possible to use electronic health record data to devise hypertension measures that may better reflect who has actionable uncontrolled blood pressure, do not penalize clinicians treating resistant hypertension patients, reduce the encouragement of potentially unsafe practices, and identify patients possibly receiving poor care with no hypertension diagnosis. This could improve the detection of true quality problems and remove incentives to over treat or stop caring for patients with resistant hypertension.
23152231	The available evidence for ADP receptor antagonists in patients with diabetes mellitus is limited and most trials do not report outcomes for patients with diabetes separately. Therefore, recommendations for the use of ADP receptor antagonists for the prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes are based on available evidence from trials including patients with and without diabetes. Trials with diabetes patients and subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes in trials with combined populations are needed to provide a more robust evidence base to guide clinical management in patients with diabetes.

2236726	Patients with a stable progression of chronic renal failure with a creatinine clearance of 15-45 mL/min were randomly assigned to two groups of antihypertensive therapy: 1--nisoldipine as the only antihypertensive agent and 2--antihypertensive drugs without calcium channel blockers and a placebo tablet instead of nisoldipine. The patients were already on a low-protein diet and some form of antihypertensive therapy but without calcium channel blockers. There were 18 patients in the placebo group and 20 patients in the nisoldipine group. The follow-up period averaged 23.7 +/- 10.6 (SD) months in the placebo group and 23 +/- 11.3 months in the nisoldipine group. The slopes of the reciprocal of serum creatinine were calculated for the period prior to and following our intervention. The number of patients whose slopes improved following intervention was 6/18 in the placebo group and 15/20 in the nisoldipine group (p less than .02). The patients whose slopes improved had a significant fall in systolic and diastolic BP, as well as in the MAP. Those whose slopes did not improve had a significant decrease in systolic BP, but no change in diastolic BP and no significant difference in the MAP. When all 38 patients are analyzed together, regardless of their grouping, the correlation between the difference percent in the slope, and the difference percent in the MAP, was significant. Furthermore, punch biopsies of the skin showed a markedly different calcium content in the two groups, which was significantly less in the nisoldipine-treated patients as compared with the patients not receiving calcium blockers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
9337224	The incidence of AF in older adults may be higher than estimated by previous population studies. Left atrial size appears to be an important risk factor, and the control of blood pressure and glucose may be important in preventing the development of AF.
19415728	Although sickle cell disease (SCD) is marked by high utilization of medical resources, the full cost of care for patients with SCD, including care not directly related to SCD, is unknown. The purpose of this study was to estimate the total cost of medical care for a population of children and adults with SCD. We used data from individuals diagnosed with SCD enrolled in the Florida Medicaid program during 2001-2005 to estimate total, SCD-related, and non-SCD-related cost per patient-month based on patient age at the time of health care use. Across the 4,294 patient samples, total health care costs generally rose with age, from $892 to $2,562 per patient-month in the 0-9- and 50-64-year age groups, respectively. Average cost per patient-month was $1,389. Overall, 51.8% of care was directly related to SCD, the majority of which (80.5%) was associated with inpatient hospitalizations. Notably, non-SCD-related costs were substantially higher than those reported for the general US population. These results suggest a discounted (3% discount rate) lifetime cost of care averaging $460,151 per patient with SCD. Interventions designed to prevent SCD complications and avoid hospitalizations may reduce the significant economic burden of the disease.
15808779	The ability to quantify the quality of cardiovascular care critically depends on the translation of recommendations for high-quality care into the measurement of that care. As payers and regulatory agencies increasingly seek to quantify healthcare quality, the implications of the measurement process on practicing physicians are likely to grow. This statement describes the methodology by which the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association approach creating performance measures and devising techniques for quantifying those aspects of care that directly reflect the quality of cardiovascular care. Methods for defining target populations, identifying dimensions of care, synthesizing the literature, and operationalizing the process of selecting measures are proposed. It is hoped that new sets of measures will be created through the implementation of this approach, and consequently, through the use of such measurement sets in the context of quality improvement efforts, the quality of cardiovascular care will improve.

18195332	RECOMMENDATION 1: In patients with serious illness at the end of life, clinicians should regularly assess patients for pain, dyspnea, and depression. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence.) RECOMMENDATION 2: In patients with serious illness at the end of life, clinicians should use therapies of proven effectiveness to manage pain. For patients with cancer, this includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and bisphosphonates. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence.) RECOMMENDATION 3: In patients with serious illness at the end of life, clinicians should use therapies of proven effectiveness to manage dyspnea, which include opioids in patients with unrelieved dyspnea and oxygen for short-term relief of hypoxemia. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence.) RECOMMENDATION 4: In patients with serious illness at the end of life, clinicians should use therapies of proven effectiveness to manage depression. For patients with cancer, this includes tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or psychosocial intervention. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence.) RECOMMENDATION 5: Clinicians should ensure that advance care planning, including completion of advance directives, occurs for all patients with serious illness. (Grade: strong recommendation, low quality of evidence.).
14683736	Coronary artery disease (CAD) as well as depression are both highly prevalent diseases. Both cause a significant decrease in quality of life for the patient and impose a significant economic burden on society. There are several factors that seem to link depression with the development of CAD and with a worse outcome in patients with established CAD: worse adherence to prescribed medication and life style modifications in depressive patients, as well as higher rates in abnormal platelet function, endothelial dysfunction and lowered heart rate variability. The evidence is growing that depression per se is an independent risk factor for cardiac events in a patient population without known CAD and also in patients with established diagnosis of CAD, particularly after myocardial infarction. Treatment of depression has been shown to improve patients' quality of life. However, it did not improve cardiovascular prognosis in depressed patients even though there is open discussion about the trend to better outcome in treated patients. Large scale clinical trials are needed to answer this question. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors seem to be preferable to tricyclic antidepressants for treatment of depressive patients with comorbid CAD because of their good tolerability and absence of significant cardiovascular side effects. Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort), an increasingly used herbal antidepressant drug should be used with caution due to severe and possibly dangerous interaction with cardioactive drugs.
18323477	In this clinical trial, patients with a CHADS(2)=1 had a low risk of stroke, yet still derived a modest (<1% per year) but statistically significant absolute reduction in stroke with OAC and had low rates of major hemorrhage on OAC.
19912973	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important reason of morbidity-mortality all over the world, affecting young males more and generating Public Health problem. Unfortunately, the advances in the pathophysiology knowledge have not followed a similar development in therapeutic options, there currently not being any contrasted neuroprotectants. In this article, we have reviewed the epidemiology, pathophysiology and therapeutic measures used in the management of patient with severe TBI. The general measures as well as those aimed at controlling intracranial hypertension, the role of the surgery and some more innovative therapeutic options currently under evaluation in these patients are analyzed.
11295963	Male sex, less education, physical inactivity, cigarette smoking, overweight, diabetes, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and coronary heart disease are all independent risk factors for CHF.

15985543	Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an uncommon but potentially devastating complication of anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Our objective was to determine and compare the incidences of HIT in surgical and medical patients receiving thromboprophylaxis with either UFH or LMWH. All relevant studies identified in the MEDLINE database (1984-2004), not limited by language, and from reference lists of key articles were evaluated. Randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials comparing prophylaxis with UFH and LMWH and measuring HIT or thrombocytopenia as outcomes were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data on thromboprophylaxis (type, dose, frequency, and duration), definition of thrombocytopenia, HIT assay, and rates of the following outcomes: HIT, thrombocytopenia, and thromboembolic events. HIT was defined as a decrease in platelets to less than 50% or to less than 100 x 10(9)/L and positive laboratory HIT assay. Fifteen studies (7287 patients) were eligible: 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) measuring HIT (1014 patients), 3 prospective studies (1464 patients) with nonrandomized comparison groups in which HIT was appropriately measured in both groups, and 10 RCTs (4809 patients) measuring thrombocytopenia but not HIT. Three analyses were performed using a random effects model and favored the use of LMWH: (1) RCTs measuring HIT showed an odds ratio (OR) of 0.10 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.2; P = .03); (2) prospective studies measuring HIT showed an OR of 0.10 (95% CI, 0.03-0.33; P < .001); (3) all 15 studies measured thrombocytopenia. The OR was 0.47 (95% CI, 0.22-1.02; P = .06). The inverse variance-weighted average that determined the absolute risk for HIT with LMWH was 0.2%, and with UFH the risk was 2.6%. Most studies were of patients after orthopedic surgery.
9072701	These results demonstrate that the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy extends to the majority of patients with coronary disease who have average cholesterol levels.
9212354	Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH) and warfarin were compared with respect to efficacy and safety in the prevention of thrombo-embolism in general surgery. Meta-analysis (MA) with a priori definition of the MA protocol was used to combine the results from randomised trials with patients who underwent general surgery and deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with LMWH, UFH or warfarin. Forty-four studies were identified for assessment and 33 were included, however, none for warfarin. For efficacy (DVT and pulmonary embolism) and major bleeding, no significant difference between the LMWH- and UFH-treated groups was demonstrated. The relative risk of minor bleedings for LMWH versus UFH was 0.75 (0.64-0.88; 95% confidence interval) and is significant (p < 0.05). Within the limitations of the MA, LMWH and UFH did not differ significantly in terms of prevention of thrombo-embolism, but LMWH had a significantly better safety profile. On this basis, LMWH may be preferable to UFH in the prevention of thrombo-embolism in general surgery.
15171224	High blood pressure (BP) is common in acute stroke and might be associated with a poor outcome, although observational studies have given varying results. In a systematic review, articles were sought that reported both admission BP and outcome (death, death or dependency, death or deterioration, stroke recurrence, and hematoma expansion) in acute stroke. Data were analyzed by the Cochrane Review Manager software and are given as odds ratios (ORs) or weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Altogether, 32 studies were identified involving 10 892 patients. When all data were included, death was significantly associated with an elevated mean arterial BP ([MABP] OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.31) and a high diastolic BP ([DBP] OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.48). Combined death or dependency was associated with high systolic BP ([SBP] OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.13 to 6.40) and DBP (OR, 4.68; 95% CI, 1.87 to 11.70) in primary intracerebral hemorrhage (PICH). Similarly, high SBP (+11.73 mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.30 to 22.16), MABP (+9.00 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.92 to 17.08), and DBP (+6.00 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.19 to 11.81) were associated with death or dependency in ischemic stroke. Combined death or deterioration was associated with a high SBP (OR, 5.57; 95% CI, 1.42 to 21.86) in patients with PICH. In summary, high BP in acute ischemic stroke or PICH is associated with subsequent death, death or dependency, and death or deterioration. Moderate lowering of BP might improve outcome. Acute BP lowering needs to be tested in 1 or more large, randomized trials.
18665405	Our purpose was to demonstrate the impact of changes in technology, staffing, and departmental processes on service levels in emergency department (ED) radiology. We also attempted to determine if report turnaround time affects ED patient throughput. Radiology performance was evaluated before and after the modifications of processes integral to the interpretation of ED imaging. Picture archiving and communication system, voice recognition (VR), staffing, physical site, work flow, and administrative modifications were undertaken over approximately 2 years. The average time interval from the exam completion to report signature was 5,184 min (standard deviation (SD) of 1,858 min before the implementation of VR and other modifications of ED radiology processes). In post initial modifications, it was 150 min (SD, 169 min) and 157 min (SD, 215 min) in post additional modifications. The percentage of the signed written reports available in less than or equal to 60 min was 0%, 27%, and 40%, respectively. Ongoing improvements are needed to increase the service levels for ED radiology. Further improvement will require collaboration and adjustment with the ongoing assessment of metrics.
19351271	The new oral, antithrombotic drug rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor, which can restrict thrombin generation both in vitro and in vivo. It has a predictable dose-dependent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and is well tolerated. In patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty, rivaroxaban, 10 mg once daily started 6 - 8 h after the operation, had a significantly better antithrombotic efficacy and a comparable safety when compared with enoxaparin. Furthermore in all studies performed the drug had no adverse influence on the liver function in comparison with enoxaparin. In conclusion, rivaroxaban is a potent and safe new compound for antithrombotic prophylaxis in orthopaedic surgery.
8941104	In subjects with mild to moderate heart failure from systolic dysfunction, carvedilol produced dose-related improvements in LV function and dose-related reductions in mortality and hospitalization rate.
15121495	Automatic referral resulted in over 50% verified cardiac rehabilitation enrollment; 2 times more than usual referral. It also significantly reduced utilization delays to less than one month.
10809037	Among patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina, variation in clinical factors using RAND appropriateness criteria for procedures explained some, but not all, racial differences in coronary revascularization use.
8084342	Regardless of the initial cause of the admission, Medicare beneficiaries who were initially hospitalized in Boston had consistently higher rates of readmission than did Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized in New Haven. Differences in the severity of illness are unlikely to explain these findings. One possible explanation is a threshold effect of hospital-bed availability on decisions to admit patients.
1495526	The angiotensin-converting--enzyme inhibitor enalapril significantly reduced the incidence of heart failure and the rate of related hospitalizations, as compared with the rates in the group given placebo, among patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. There was also a trend toward fewer deaths due to cardiovascular causes among the patients who received enalapril.
12850656	The ACCORD trial strategy of intensive glycemic control did not lead to benefits in HRQL and was associated with modest improvement in diabetes treatment satisfaction. Thus patient acceptability was apparently not compromised with intensive and complex interventions such as those used in ACCORD.
10888989	Low-molecular-weight heparin administered once daily subcutaneously was no less effective and probably more effective than use of dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with PE and associated proximal deep vein thrombosis. Our findings extend the use of low-molecular-weight heparin without anticoagulant monitoring to patients with submassive PE.
18071185	Collaborative care is more effective than standard care in improving depression outcomes in the short and longer terms. Future research needs to address the implementation of collaborative care, particularly in settings other than the United States.
19407734	Since 1994, disability-related costs for medical care and lost productivity have exceeded an estimated $300 billion annually in the United States. To update previous reports on the prevalence and most common causes of disability among adults, CDC and the U.S. Census Bureau analyzed the most recent data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). This report summarizes the findings of that analysis, which indicated that the prevalence of disability in 2005 (21.8%) remained unchanged from 1999 (22.0%); however, because of the aging of the population, particularly the large group born during 1946-1964 ("baby boomers"), the estimated absolute number of persons reporting a disability increased 7.7%, from 44.1 to 47.5 million. The three most common causes of disability continued to be arthritis or rheumatism (affecting an estimated 8.6 million persons), back or spine problems (7.6 million), and heart trouble (3.0 million). Women (24.4%) had a significantly higher prevalence of disability compared with men (19.1%) at all ages. For both sexes, the prevalence of disability doubled in successive age groups (18-44 years, 11.0%; 45-64 years, 23.9%; and >/=65 years, 51.8%). The number of adults reporting a disability likely will increase, along with the need for appropriate medical and public health services, as more persons enter the highest risk age group (>/=65 years). To accommodate the expected increase in demand for disability-related medical and public health services, expanding the reach of effective strategies and interventions aimed at preventing progression to disability and improving disability management in the population is necessary.
11086524	Members of racial/ethnic minority groups are less likely than Caucasians to access mental health services despite recent evidence of more favorable attitudes regarding treatment effectiveness. The present study explored this discrepancy by examining racial differences in beliefs about how the natural course and seriousness of mental illnesses relate to perceived treatment effectiveness. The analysis is based on a nationally representative sample of 583 Caucasian and 82 African American participants in a vignette experiment about people living with mental illness. While African Americans were more likely than Caucasians to believe that mental health professionals could help individuals with schizophrenia and major depression, they were also more likely to believe mental health problems would improve on their own. This belief was unrelated to beliefs about treatment effectiveness. These findings suggest that a belief in treatment effectiveness may not increase service utilization among African Americans who are more likely to believe treatment is unnecessary.
19581110	Evidence-based CHF patient education resources promote self-care practices and early detection of symptom change that may reduce hospitalisations and improve the quality of life for people with CHF.
16868288	For women and men, aspirin therapy reduced the risk of a composite of cardiovascular events due to its effect on reducing the risk of ischemic stroke in women and MI in men. Aspirin significantly increased the risk of bleeding to a similar degree among women and men.
22531598	Aspirin therapy may reduce cerebrovascular events in diabetic patients with higher BP. Aspirin therapy could be an additional strategy as primary prevention for diabetic patients with higher BP.
18815401	As compared with placebo, intravenous alteplase administered between 3 and 4.5 hours after the onset of symptoms significantly improved clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke; alteplase was more frequently associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00153036.)
7969344	Tremendous debate has developed over the efficacy of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared with fibrinolysis as the preferred treatment for acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In 2002, the Ontario Ministry of Heath and Long-Term Care commissioned the Cardiac Care Network of Ontario to develop consensus recommendations regarding the provincial coordination and provision of urgent PCI for STEMI patients. The panel's work has provided important insights into the acute treatment of STEMI that may be useful to other jurisdictions and may provide a reference for other regions considering the implementation of primary PCI for the management of STEMI patients in their community. In the present report, the evidence for primary PCI is reviewed, the important barriers to implementing this strategy are summarized and several recommendations and models of care for the delivery of primary PCI for STEMI on a wide scale are presented.
14519702	Quitting smoking is associated with a substantial reduction in risk of all-cause mortality among patients with CHD. This risk reduction appears to be consistent regardless of age, sex, index cardiac event, country, and year of study commencement.
20331952	The number of individuals with SCD in the U.S. may approach 100,000, even when accounting for the effect of early mortality on estimations. A paucity of high-quality data limits appropriate estimation. State-to-state variability may preclude application of state-specific information to other states or to the nation as a whole. Standardized collection and centralized reporting, a surveillance system, will be necessary to assess the size and composition of the U.S. SCD population.
16865828	A wide variety of secondary prevention programs improve health outcomes in patients with coronary disease.
15518446	This review confirms the benefits of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation within the context of today's cardiovascular service provision.
12202838	Depression is common and persistent in AMI survivors. Prevalence varies depending on assessment method, likely reflecting treatment of somatic symptoms.
16944852	Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce total mortality and major cardiovascular end points in patients who have CAD and no left ventricular systolic dysfunction or heart failure.
15330739	For patients with coronary heart disease, intensive lipid-lowering treatment with atorvastatin reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis compared with pravastatin. Compared with baseline values, patients treated with atorvastatin had no change in atheroma burden, whereas patients treated with pravastatin showed progression of coronary atherosclerosis. These differences may be related to the greater reduction in atherogenic lipoproteins and C- reactive protein in patients treated with atorvastatin.
22825029	Risk of AMI is substantially increased in the first 2 weeks after THR (25-fold) and TKR (31-fold) surgery compared with controls. Risk assessment of AMI should be considered during the first 6 weeks after THR surgery and during the first 2 weeks after TKR surgery.
19043026	A strategy of intensive glucose control, involving gliclazide (modified release) and other drugs as required, that lowered the glycated hemoglobin value to 6.5% yielded a 10% relative reduction in the combined outcome of major macrovascular and microvascular events, primarily as a consequence of a 21% relative reduction in nephropathy. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00145925.)
18837144	As compared with standard therapy, the use of intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin levels for 3.5 years increased mortality and did not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events. These findings identify a previously unrecognized harm of intensive glucose lowering in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00000620.)
10835439	Early aspirin is of benefit for a wide range of patients, and its prompt use should be routinely considered for all patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke, mainly to reduce the risk of early recurrence.
16009859	Among hospitals providing care for patients with heart failure, there is significant individual variability in conformity to quality-of-care indicators and clinical outcomes and a substantial gap in overall performance. Establishing educational initiatives and quality improvement systems to reduce this variability and eliminate this gap would be expected to substantially improve the care of these patients.
16785338	Improving diet and lifestyle is a critical component of the American Heart Association's strategy for cardiovascular disease risk reduction in the general population. This document presents recommendations designed to meet this objective. Specific goals are to consume an overall healthy diet; aim for a healthy body weight; aim for recommended levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides; aim for normal blood pressure; aim for a normal blood glucose level; be physically active; and avoid use of and exposure to tobacco products. The recommendations are to balance caloric intake and physical activity to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight; consume a diet rich in vegetables and fruits; choose whole-grain, high-fiber foods; consume fish, especially oily fish, at least twice a week; limit intake of saturated fat to <7% of energy, trans fat to <1% of energy, and cholesterol to <300 mg/day by choosing lean meats and vegetable alternatives, fat-free (skim) or low-fat (1% fat) dairy products and minimize intake of partially hydrogenated fats; minimize intake of beverages and foods with added sugars; choose and prepare foods with little or no salt; if you consume alcohol, do so in moderation; and when you eat food prepared outside of the home, follow these Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations. By adhering to these diet and lifestyle recommendations, Americans can substantially reduce their risk of developing cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.
3621532	To assess the intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic effects of beta-blockade and its benefits in limiting myocardial ischemia and infarction, a group of 32 patients scheduled for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery (group 1) was treated with oral metoprolol immediately before surgery and with intravenous metoprolol during the postoperative period. Mean age was 71 years, and mean ejection fraction was 56% (range 36% to 83%). Eight patients had a preoperative history of angina, 13 had a history of myocardial infarction, and five had electrocardiographic evidence of prior myocardial infarction. A group of 51 closely matched patients with AAA who did not receive metoprolol served as controls (group 2). In group 1, overall hemodynamic tolerance of metoprolol intraoperatively and postoperatively was good, and there was no incidence of congestive heart failure, hypotension, or asthma. Furthermore, in group 1 significant reduction of systolic blood pressure and heart rate was consistently noted at frequent intraoperative intervals and for 48 hr after surgery, with only a transient reduction of cardiac index. In group 1, only one patient (3%) suffered an acute myocardial infarction. In contrast, nine group 2 patients (18%; p less than .05) suffered perioperative myocardial infarction. Furthermore, only four (12.5%) group 1 patients developed significant cardiac arrhythmias as opposed to 29 group 2 patients (56.9%; p less than .001). These data demonstrate that beta-blockade with metoprolol is effective in controlling systolic blood pressure and heart rate both intraoperatively and postoperatively in patients undergoing repair of AAA and can significantly reduce the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction and arrhythmias.
18518933	Similar to previously reported meta-analyses, we did not find a significant effect of CRRT on the OR of survival. The progressive reduction in the OR of survival with CRRT relative to IHD might reflect progressive improvements in IHD. The OR of DD was not affected by mode of RRT. In conclusion, compared with IHD, CRRT does not offer an advantage with regards to survival or DD in ARF. Considering its cost and potential disadvantages, it is imperative to identify the subset of patients with ARF that would potentially derive maximum benefit from CRRT. This will require large, adequately powered studies with sufficient follow-up.
19752407	Almost 1 in 3 patients with stable angina attending primary care practices had angina at least once a week, which was associated with worse quality of life. Moreover, weekly (> or =1) angina varied considerably across clinics, possibly reflecting variability in the identification and management of angina. The potential role of an angina performance measure to improve patients' outcomes, including symptom control, warrants further consideration.
18402898	Mean lipid levels vary relatively little in the 4 days after an ACS and can be used to guide selection of lipid-lowering medication.
9280815	Fixed-dose, subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin is as effective and safe as adjusted-dose, intravenous unfractionated heparin for the initial management of venous thromboembolism, regardless of whether the patient has pulmonary embolism or a history of venous thromboembolism.
16753530	This review highlights disparities in referral to CR and reveals a treatment gap in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Precise estimates of the impact of all factors on referral are not possible, but some hierarchies and potential priorities for action are evident.
10426333	We evaluated whether elevated blood pressure (BP) levels with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) affect the in-hospital course, short-term, and 1-year outcome. Data were derived from a nationwide survey of 2,212 consecutive patients with AMI. Patients were stratified into 3 groups according to admission BP levels: 1,320 patients had normal BP, 840 patients had high BP, and 52 patients had excessive BP. In-hospital (7 days) course, short-term (30 days), and 1-year outcome was compared between the groups. The 3 groups were similar with respect to age, but patients with excessive BP were more likely to be women and have a history of systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The rate of thrombolytic therapy was similar among the 3 groups, but patients with excessively elevated BP were treated during hospitalization much more often with beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics. The incidence of stroke, transient ischemic attack, and bleeding complications were comparable in the 3 groups. In-hospital mortality was 5.0% , 4.0%, and 1.9% in the normal, high, and excessively elevated BP groups, respectively (p = 0.19). The short-term rehospitalization or mortality rate was similar among the 3 groups. The 1-year mortality rate was 12.3%, 14.1%, and 10.2% in the normal, high, and excessively elevated BP groups, respectively (p = 0.61). A multivariate logistic regression analysis yielded age, women, and Killip class > or = 2 as the only significant predictors of mortality during follow-up. Thus, with the current medical therapy, excessively elevated BP levels with AMI is not associated with a worse short-term or 1-year outcome.
9647493	The effect of enalapril (5-10 mg/day) on the progression of chronic renal failure (CRF) was compared with that of metoprolol (40-120 mg/day) in 28 patients for 24 months in a prospective study. Throughout the study, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in protein intake and urinary sodium excretion. But there was a significant difference between the 2 groups in diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure at 6 months. In the serum creatinine level, there was a significant difference between the 2 groups at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. In creatinine clearance, there was a significant difference between the 2 groups at 24 months. In addition, the progression of CRF was significantly faster in the metoprolol group than the enalapril group as estimated from the slope of creatinine clearance (p < 0.05) and the slope of glomerular filtration rate (p < 0.0005). In urinary protein excretion, there was a significant difference between the 2 groups at 6 and 18 months (p < 0.05). These findings indicate that enalapril has a suppressive effect on the progression of CRF and also has an antiproteinuric effect by a mechanism independent of its antihypertensive effect.
19555837	Mortality rates were 21% to 34% lower in CR users than nonusers in this socioeconomically and clinically diverse, older population after extensive analyses to control for potential confounding. These results are of similar magnitude to those observed in published randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses in younger, more selected populations.
18842226	Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a neurologic emergency and often a neurologic catastrophe. Nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is characterized by the extravasation of blood into the spaces covering the central nervous system. The leading cause of SAH is rupture of an intracranial aneurysm, which accounts for about 80-85% of cases. Mortality and morbidity can be reduced if SAH is treated urgently. Sudden, explosive headache is a cardinal but nonspecific feature in the diagnosis of SAH; computered tomography (CT) scanning is mandatory in all the patients with symp toms that are suggestive of SAH. Catheter angiography for detecting aneurysms is gradually being replaced by CT angiography. Diagnosing SAH can be challenging and treatment is complex, sophisticated and multidisciplinary. Reble eding is the most imminent danger, which must be prevented by endovascular occlusion with detachable coils (coiling) or by surgical clipping of the aneurysm; the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia is reduced with nimodipine and avoiding hypovolemia; hydrocephalus can be treated by ventricular drainage. Intensive care plays a more important role in the management of SAH than in any other neurological disorder. Excellence in neurologic diagnosis, in operative neurosurgery or neuroradiologic procedures must be accompanied by excellence in Intensive Care. This review emphasizes treatment in the Intensive Care Unit, surgical and endovascular therapeutic options and the current state of treatment of major complications such as rebleeding, cerebral vasospasm and acute hydrocephalus.
12479771	Pravastatin did not reduce either all-cause mortality or CHD significantly when compared with usual care in older participants with well-controlled hypertension and moderately elevated LDL-C. The results may be due to the modest differential in total cholesterol (9.6%) and LDL-C (16.7%) between pravastatin and usual care compared with prior statin trials supporting cardiovascular disease prevention.
18623200	Despite evidence that routine screening to assess stroke risk is vital to the preventive care of SCD, implementation of this healthcare technology may be slow to disseminate due to patient and provider related factors.
16551325	This study examined how health services research connects with practice and policy, first by investigating whether successful research projects continued in their test settings and engendered replication and then by examining whether a coherent body of research helped shape public policy. Chronic heart failure (CHF) was studied because randomized, controlled trials of posthospital CHF disease management have repeatedly demonstrated patient benefits and reduced costs, yet this practice has not become standard in the United States. Literature review produced 30 randomized, controlled trials of multidisciplinary outpatient CHF management, generally yielding improved patient outcomes. An e-mail survey of first authors (97% response rate) showed that practices proven to be effective in U.S. studies generally did not continue or expand (13 of 15 studies), mostly attributed to financial constraints (11 of 13), whereas similar projects in other countries often became permanent (7 of 13). U.S. respondents generally rated current quality of clinical care as good, whereas those elsewhere mostly rated it as excellent. Recent Medicare reforms implemented a model of CHF management substantially different from those studied in health services research. The Congressional hearings leading to these Medicare reforms, and the statute itself, mostly evidence the model used by commercial disease-management firms. Policy-makers, health service researchers, and funding agencies could develop more-effective methods for translating proven models of healthcare delivery into routine practice. Reforms that might improve the effectiveness of the linkages between research, policy, and practice are suggested.
22744996	Publicly insured children with HbSS or HbS(0) had increasing adherence with TCD screening guidelines between 1997 and 2008, though 31% had no TCD at all during follow-up. Increasing number of sickle cell related outpatient visits was associated with increasing adherence to screening guidelines.
14657426	 CT colonography (CTC) screening is increasingly used to identify potential colorectal cancer.  Clinically presenting cancers are rare for 5years following negative CTC screening.  The practice of setting a 6mm polyp size threshold seems safe.  An interval of 5years for routine CTC screening is appropriate.
1361636	An association between raised renin levels and myocardial infarction has been reported. We studied the effects of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on the development of myocardial infarction and unstable angina in 6797 patients with ejection fractions < or = 0.35 enrolled into the two Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) trials. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 3401) or enalapril (n = 3396) at doses of 2.5-20 mg per day in two concurrent double-blind trials with the same protocol. Patients with heart failure entered the treatment trial (n = 2569) and those without heart failure entered the prevention trial (n = 4228). Follow-up averaged 40 months. In each trial there were significant reductions in the number of patients developing myocardial infarction (treatment trial: 158 placebo vs 127 enalapril, p < 0.02; prevention trial: 204 vs 161 p < 0.01) or unstable angina (240 vs 187 p < 0.001; 355 vs 312, p < 0.05). Combined, there were 362 placebo group patients with myocardial infarction compared with 288 in the enalapril group (risk reduction 23%, 95% CI 11-34%; p < 0.001). 595 placebo group patients developed unstable angina compared with 499 in the enalapril group (risk reduction 20%, 95% CI 9-29%, p < 0.001). There was also a reduction in cardiac deaths (711 placebo, 615 enalapril; p < 0.003), so that the reduction in the combined endpoint of deaths, myocardial infarction, and unstable angina was highly significant (20% risk reduction, 95% CI 14-26%; p < 0.0001). Enalapril treatment significantly reduced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiac mortality in patients with low ejection fractions.
20398858	The management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage demands expertise to anticipate, recognise, and promptly treat the many neurological and systemic complications. For this reason, these patients are best cared for in high-volume medical centres with multidisciplinary teams and should preferably be treated in a specialised intensive care unit. Endovascular occlusion and surgical clipping provide complementary alternatives for the treatment of aneurysms. Perfusion scans are redefining the way we detect delayed ischaemia as a growing body of evidence indicates that monitoring vessel diameter is insufficient to prevent cerebral infarctions. Statins, endothelin antagonists, and magnesium sulfate infusion are among the novel strategies being tested for neuroprotection and attenuation of vasospasm. The effectiveness of these treatments is supported by strong experimental data and they represent a new generation of therapeutic options developed from the understanding that vasospasm is primarily caused by endothelial dysfunction.
7565979	A nurse-directed, multidisciplinary intervention can improve quality of life and reduce hospital use and medical costs for elderly patients with congestive heart failure.
9718054	Many ideal patients for beta-blocker therapy are not prescribed these drugs at discharge following AMI. The clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients do not explain much of the variation in the treatment pattern. Geographic factors and physician specialty are independently associated with the decision to use beta-blockers. Elderly patients who are prescribed beta-blockers at discharge have a better survival rate, consistent with the findings of randomized controlled trials of younger and lower-risk populations.
2447297	This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compares the effects of captopril treatment with those of digoxin treatment during maintenance diuretic therapy in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. Compared with placebo, captopril therapy resulted in significantly improved exercise time (mean increase, 82 s vs 35 s) and improved New York Heart Association class (41% vs 22%), but digoxin therapy did not. Digoxin treatment increased ejection fraction (4.4% increase) compared with captopril therapy (1.8% increase) and placebo (0.9% increase). The number of ventricular premature beats decreased 45% in the captopril group and increased 4% in the digoxin group in patients with more than ten ventricular premature beats per hour. Treatment failures, increased requirements for diuretic therapy, and hospitalizations were significantly more frequent in patients receiving placebo compared with those receiving either active drug. Transitory hypotension occurred more frequently with administration of captopril. Captopril treatment is significantly more effective than placebo and is an alternative to digoxin therapy in patients with mild to moderate heart failure who are receiving diuretic maintenance therapy.
7717276	A rehabilitation program that relied totally upon the primary health care system was created in Gteborg, Sweden, for patients > or = 65 years old with acute myocardial infarction. Patients from one primary health care district were assigned to a rehabilitation program (n = 91), while patients from a neighboring district constituted a control group (n = 99). The rehabilitation measures were initiated very early after the infarction with individual counseling in the home of the patient and later in the local health center, where 21% of the patients also joined a low-intensity exercise group. The control group was somewhat older and contained a greater number of women compared with the rehabilitation group, but size and course of infarction, complications, and previous morbidity were similar. To control for differences in age, a matching procedure was performed and 71 pairs of the same sex and age were found. During the first 3 months there was a significantly lower incidence of rehospitalization in the intervention group, regarding both percentage of patients (p < 0.04) and days of rehospitalization (p = 0.05). Visits to the emergency department without rehospitalization were also significantly lower in the intervention group (p = 0.005). After 12 months the differences still remained, with the exception of days of rehospitalization. In the matched groups the same result was seen. While readmissions and emergency department visits generally were well justified in the intervention group, vague symptoms dominated among the controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
20217988	A once-daily dose of rivaroxaban 10 mg, an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor, was compared with enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily for prevention of venous thromboembolism in three studies of patients undergoing elective hip and knee replacement (RECORD programme). A pooled analysis of data from these studies (n = 9581) showed that rivaroxaban was more effective than enoxaparin in reducing the incidence of the composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism and all-cause mortality at two weeks (0.4% vs 0.8%, respectively, odds ratio 0.44; 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.79; p = 0.005), and at the end of the planned medication period (0.5% vs 1.3%, respectively; odds ratio 0.38; 95% confidence interval 0.22 to 0.62; p < 0.001). The rate of major bleeding was similar at two weeks (0.2% for both) and at the end of the planned medication period (0.3% vs 0.2%). Rivaroxaban started six to eight hours after surgery was more effective than enoxaparin started the previous evening in preventing symptomatic venous thromboembolism and all-cause mortality, without increasing major bleeding.
9550501	Hypercholesterolemia, particularly an elevated level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, is an unarguably established risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). It is equally well established that lowering LDL cholesterol levels will decrease CAD-related morbidity and mortality in patients with established CAD. Although lipid-lowering therapy is known to retard the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with native coronary arteries, its effect in patients with coronary bypass grafts, which are particularly vulnerable to occlusion, is less well understood. Moreover, whereas several major clinical trials have documented the benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol in a variety of patient subpopulations, there has been far less clarity surrounding the question of whether aggressive lowering of LDL cholesterol is of greater benefit than moderate lowering of LDL cholesterol. The Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (Post-CABG) trial, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial comprising 1,351 patients with elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and a history of bypass surgery was designed to determine whether aggressive lowering of LDL cholesterol levels with therapy based on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors ("statins") is more effective than moderate lowering in delaying the progression of atherosclerosis in bypass grafts. Quantitative computer-assisted angiography was conducted at baseline and again at an average of 4.3 years. The primary angiographic outcome was the mean percentage per patient of grafts with a decrease of > or = 0.6 mm in lumen diameter. Patients who received aggressive therapy were significantly more likely than their moderate-treatment counterparts to achieve and maintain LDL cholesterol levels within the National Cholesterol Education Program's (NCEP's) recommended target of < or = 100 mg/dL (< or = 2.59 mmol/L). Moreover, the mean percentage of grafts with progression of atherosclerosis was 27% for aggressively treated patients, compared with 39% for those who were randomized to the moderate-treatment group (p < 0.001). This study demonstrates that aggressive lipid lowering is practical and worthwhile in at-risk patients. Aggressive treatment is far more effective than moderate treatment in lowering LDL cholesterol levels to the NCEP target level of < or = 100 mg/dL (< or = 2.59 mmol/L), and this intervention decreases the progression of atherosclerosis.

10925988	This article presents a cost-effectiveness analysis of colorectal cancer screening tests that have been recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, American Cancer Society US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer American College of Radiology, or the American College of Gastroenterology. This cost-effectiveness analysis supports a common theme of the 3 guideline groups that there are multiple acceptable colorectal cancer screening strategies (including colonoscopy). The article shows which recommended strategies are also cost-effective given a range of willingness to pay per life-year gained. The set of cost-effective strategies includes tests that primarily detect cancer early (annual sensitive fecal occult blood tests [FOBTs]; either guaiac or fecal immunochemical tests, but not Hemoccult II), as well as those that can prevent colorectal cancer (flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years with a frequent sensitive FOBT [but not flexible sigmoidoscopy as a standalone test], and colonoscopy). Computed tomographic colonography was not a cost-effective strategy. Stool DNA testing was not assessed in the analysis for this article.
15674879	RCTs evaluating education for people with diabetes, aimed at preventing diabetic foot ulceration, are mostly of poor methodological quality. Existing data suggests that patient education may reduce foot ulceration and amputations, especially in high-risk patients. Foot care knowledge and behaviour of patients seem positively influenced by patient education in the short term. Because of conflicting results and the methodological shortcomings more RCTs are needed.
8985799	Cardiac rehabilitation programs are used by a minority of eligible patients, particularly among women, nonwhites, and the elderly. To meet newly released national guidelines that recommend CR services for most patients recovering from MI, PTCA, or CABS, and to still contain costs, new methods need to be explored that can expand the delivery of CR services in clinical settings.
19028391	Recent decreases in SCD mortality in black children under age 4 years coincided with the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, although temporal association is not evidence of causation. The lack of significant recent reduction in SCD mortality in older children indicates the need for new treatment approaches.

15701916	Assuming equal effectiveness in stroke prevention and decreased hemorrhage risk, ximelagatran is not likely to be cost-effective in patients with atrial fibrillation unless they have a high risk of intracranial hemorrhage or a low quality of life with warfarin.
15052108	The reported outcomes statement is an update to the previous recommendations for outcomes evaluation in cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention programs. The purposes of outcomes evaluation are reviewed, and practical information with examples is provided to help programs implement an outcomes-directed approach within routine patient care and program management functions.
12711500	Throughout middle and old age, usual blood pressure is strongly and directly related to vascular (and overall) mortality, without any evidence of a threshold down to at least 115/75 mm Hg.
22184711	Neither clinic nor home measurement had sufficient sensitivity or specificity to be recommended as a single diagnostic test. If ambulatory monitoring is taken as the reference standard, then treatment decisions based on clinic or home blood pressure alone might result in substantial overdiagnosis. Ambulatory monitoring before the start of lifelong drug treatment might lead to more appropriate targeting of treatment, particularly around the diagnostic threshold.
18039450	The consensus document establishes the following priorities: 1. To apply the set of general measures recommended for the care of STEMI patients strictly and appropriately 2. To foster the use of early reperfusion in as many patients as possible, promoting the extension of fibrinolysis outside of hospitals and referral to a center with facilities for primary percutaneous coronary intervention. 3. To monitor and evaluate the management of these patients, with special attention placed on outcome and safety.
17335357	An integrated multifactorial approach is essential in addressing the underutilization of therapies available for secondary prevention of CAD. Managed care organizations are in a unique position to optimize the use of evidence-based pharmacological and behavioral therapies to effectively prevent and treat the underlying pathophysiology of CAD in member populations.
14981060	The National High Blood Pressure Education Program presents the complete Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Like its predecessors, the purpose is to provide an evidence-based approach to the prevention and management of hypertension. The key messages of this report are these: in those older than age 50, systolic blood pressure (BP) of greater than 140 mm Hg is a more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, CVD risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; those who are normotensive at 55 years of age will have a 90% lifetime risk of developing hypertension; prehypertensive individuals (systolic BP 120-139 mm Hg or diastolic BP 80-89 mm Hg) require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in blood pressure and CVD; for uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretic should be used in drug treatment for most, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes; this report delineates specific high-risk conditions that are compelling indications for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mm Hg, or <130/80 mm Hg) for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease; for patients whose BP is more than 20 mm Hg above the systolic BP goal or more than 10 mm Hg above the diastolic BP goal, initiation of therapy using two agents, one of which usually will be a thiazide diuretic, should be considered; regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will be controlled only if patients are motivated to stay on their treatment plan. Positive experiences, trust in the clinician, and empathy improve patient motivation and satisfaction. This report serves as a guide, and the committee continues to recognize that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.
18574271	This article discusses the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggestions imply that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full discussion of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendation" chapter by Guyatt et al). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: we recommend that every hospital develop a formal strategy that addresses the prevention of VTE (Grade 1A). We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A), and we recommend that mechanical methods of thromboprophylaxis be used primarily for patients at high bleeding risk (Grade 1A) or possibly as an adjunct to anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis (Grade 2A). For patients undergoing major general surgery, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), or fondaparinux (each Grade 1A). We recommend routine thromboprophylaxis for all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery or major, open urologic procedures (Grade 1A for both groups), with LMWH, LDUH, fondaparinux, or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC). For patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty, we recommend one of the following three anticoagulant agents: LMWH, fondaparinux, or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA); international normalized ratio (INR) target, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0 (each Grade 1A). For patients undergoing hip fracture surgery (HFS), we recommend the routine use of fondaparinux (Grade 1A), LMWH (Grade 1B), a VKA (target INR, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1B], or LDUH (Grade 1B). We recommend that patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty or HFS receive thromboprophylaxis for a minimum of 10 days (Grade 1A); for hip arthroplasty and HFS, we recommend continuing thromboprophylaxis > 10 days and up to 35 days (Grade 1A). We recommend that all major trauma and all spinal cord injury (SCI) patients receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A). In patients admitted to hospital with an acute medical illness, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with LMWH, LDUH, or fondaparinux (each Grade 1A). We recommend that, on admission to the ICU, all patients be assessed for their risk of VTE, and that most receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A).
18574272	This chapter about treatment for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see "Grades of Recommendation" chapter). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous (SC) low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), monitored IV, or SC unfractionated heparin (UFH), unmonitored weight-based SC UFH, or SC fondaparinux (all Grade 1A). For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C). For patients with confirmed PE, we recommend early evaluation of the risks to benefits of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1C); for those with hemodynamic compromise, we recommend short-course thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B); and for those with nonmassive PE, we recommend against the use of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). In acute DVT or PE, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux for at least 5 days rather than a shorter period (Grade 1C); and initiation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) together with LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of these heparin preparations when the international normalized ratio (INR) is > or = 2.0 for at least 24 h (Grade 1A). For patients with DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 3 months (Grade 1A), and that all patients are then evaluated for the risks to benefits of indefinite therapy (Grade 1C). We recommend indefinite anticoagulant therapy for patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE and a low risk of bleeding when this is consistent with the patient's preference (Grade 1A), and for most patients with a second unprovoked DVT (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend at least 3 months of treatment with LMWH for patients with VTE and cancer (Grade 1A), followed by treatment with LMWH or VKA as long as the cancer is active (Grade 1C). For prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) after proximal DVT, we recommend use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For DVT of the upper extremity, we recommend similar treatment as for DVT of the leg (Grade 1C). Selected patients with lower-extremity (Grade 2B) and upper-extremity (Grade 2C). DVT may be considered for thrombus removal, generally using catheter-based thrombolytic techniques. For extensive superficial vein thrombosis, we recommend treatment with prophylactic or intermediate doses of LMWH or intermediate doses of UFH for 4 weeks (Grade 1B).
1554003	The effects of implementing a warfarin-monitoring service for inpatients were evaluated. The pharmacy-managed service includes chart review, laboratory interpretation, recommendations for warfarin dosage adjustments, physician and patient education, and coordination of follow-up in the outpatient anticoagulation clinic. In a before-after trial, 52 patients monitored by the warfarin-monitoring service were compared with 97 patients who received warfarin before the service was implemented. Significantly fewer determinations of prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were ordered for after-trial patients compared with before-trial patients. PT stability at hospital discharge was significantly improved in after-trial patients. After-trial patients were 12.2 times more likely to be referred to the anticoagulation clinic. No difference was found between the before and after groups in overall compliance with follow-up; however, among patients with no history of substance abuse, after-trial patients were 6.7 times more likely to be compliant. The warfarin-monitoring service had no significant effect on the number of hospital visits and readmissions related to toxicity and recurrence of thrombosis. After-trial patients were 5.4 times more likely to have a therapeutic PT at the initial follow-up appointment. The warfarin-monitoring service improved warfarin dose determination, improved PT stability, and increased referrals to the anticoagulation clinic; among patients with no history of substance abuse, it also improved clinic compliance.
19579271	In this large, international, randomized trial, we found that intensive glucose control increased mortality among adults in the ICU: a blood glucose target of 180 mg or less per deciliter resulted in lower mortality than did a target of 81 to 108 mg per deciliter. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00220987.)
15383128	Individuals with bipolar disorder possess a substantial burden of general medical comorbidity, and are occurring at an earlier age than in the general VA patient population, suggesting the need for earlier detection and treatment for patients with bipolar disorder.
17940514	Use of warfarin has increased, and bleeding from warfarin use is a prevalent reaction and an important cause of mortality. Consequently, a "black box" warning about warfarin's bleeding risk was added to the US product labeling in 2006. Physicians and nurses should tell patients to immediately report signs and symptoms of bleeding. A Medication Guide, which is required to be provided with each prescription, reinforces this message.
8526459	According to high-quality evidence, enhanced glucose control significantly prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve conduction and vibration threshold abnormalities in type 1 diabetes mellitus. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, enhanced glucose control reduces the incidence of clinical neuropathy, although this was not formally statistically significant (P = 0.06). However, enhanced glucose control does significantly reduce nerve conduction and vibration threshold abnormalities. Importantly, enhanced glucose control significantly increases the risk of severe hypoglycemic episodes, which needs to be taken into account when evaluating its risk/benefit ratio.

11453714	Antihypertensive regimens that include ACE inhibitors are more effective than regimens without ACE inhibitors in slowing the progression of nondiabetic renal disease. The beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors is mediated by factors in addition to decreasing blood pressure and urinary protein excretion and is greater in patients with proteinuria. Angiotensin-converting inhibitors are indicated for treatment of nondiabetic patients with chronic renal disease and proteinuria and, possibly, those without proteinuria.
19931943	Since the advent of cardiopulmonary resuscitation more than 40 years ago, we have achieved a return to spontaneous circulation in a growing proportion of patients with cardiac arrest. Nevertheless, most of these patients die in the first few days after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and this situation has not improved over the years. Mortality in these patients is mainly associated to brain damage. Perhaps recognizing that cardiopulmonary resuscitation does not end with the return of spontaneous circulation but rather with the return of normal brain function and total stabilization of the patient would help improve the therapeutic management of these patients in the ICU. In this sense, the term cardiocerebral resuscitation proposed by some authors might be more appropriate. The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation recently published a consensus document on the "Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome" and diverse authors have proposed that post-arrest care be integrated as the fifth link in the survival chain, after early warning, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation by witnesses, early defibrillation, and early advanced life support. The therapeutic management of patients that recover spontaneous circulation after cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers based on life support measures and a series of improvised actions based on "clinical judgment" might not be the best way to treat patients with post-cardiac arrest syndrome. Recent studies indicate that using goal-guided protocols to manage these patients including therapeutic measures of proven efficacy, such as inducing mild therapeutic hypothermia and early revascularization, when indicated, can improve the prognosis considerably in these patients. Given that there is no current protocol based on universally accepted evidence, the Steering Committee of the National Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Plan of the Spanish Society of Intensive Medicine and Cardiac Units has elaborated this document after a thorough review of the literature and an online discussion involving all the members of the committee and a consensus meeting with the aim of providing a platform for the development of local protocols in different ICSs in our country to fit their own means and characteristics.
8540789	This study demonstrates that early swallow screening and dysphagia management in patients with acute stroke reduces the risk of aspiration pneumonia, is cost effective, and assures quality care with optimal outcome.
14668421	Adjusted doses of oral warfarin sodium or fixed doses of subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are the standard approaches for preventing venous thromboembolism following major orthopedic surgery of the legs. In recent years, new anticoagulants have been compared with either LMWH or warfarin. The optimal timing for the first dose of LMWH prophylaxis and of the new anticoagulants is controversial. Recent clinical trials of LMWH and of newer anticoagulants have provided new information on the relationship between the timing of the first anticoagulant dose and the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery. These data on the optimal timing of initiating prophylaxis come from limited direct randomized comparisons of different timing with the same anticoagulant, subgroup analysis of large studies with a single anticoagulant, indirect comparisons across studies in systematic reviews, and single randomized trials comparing different anticoagulants. In the direct comparison of the same anticoagulant, preoperative initiation of the same regimen of LMWH (dalteparin) increased major bleeding, without improved antithrombotic efficacy compared to the early postoperative regimen. Fondaparinux, 2.5 mg, begun 6 h postoperatively is more effective and as safe as the currently approved regimens of enoxaparin begun either 12 h preoperatively, or 12 to 24 h postoperatively, in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. In a subgroup analysis of several large randomized trials, fondaparinux, 2.5 mg, begun < 6 h postoperatively was associated with increased major bleeding, without improved efficacy. The results of indirect comparisons also favor the use of a 6-h postoperative starting time for the first dose, while the single randomized trials comparing different anticoagulants performed to date are not helpful in establishing an optimal time for the first dose. The aggregate clinical research evidence supports the following general conclusions about the relationship between the timing of the first anticoagulant dose and the efficacy and safety of prophylaxis: (1) preoperative initiation is not required for good efficacy and, when begun within 2 h of surgery, increases major bleeding; (2) initiation at 6 h postoperatively is effective and not associated with increased major bleeding; (3) initiation < 6 h postoperatively increases major bleeding, without improved efficacy; thus, 6 h appears to be the threshold for early postoperative administration; and (4) initiation 12 to 24 h postoperatively may be less effective than initiation at 6 h, but further randomized trials comparing the same anticoagulant initiated at different times postoperatively (eg, 6 h vs 12 h) are required to establish definitively the optimal timing of the first anticoagulant dose.
6346847	The efficacy and safety of a new diuretic-antihypertensive drug, indapamide (2.5 mg/day), were evaluated in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, in patients with various degrees of chronic renal failure, and in hypertensive patients undergoing long-term maintenance hemodialysis. The results obtained from single-blind, placebo-controlled studies indicate that indapamide is a safe and effective agent to use in lowering the blood pressure of hypertensive patients with normal renal function, those with various degrees of renal impairment, and those who are undergoing long-term maintenance hemodialysis. No significant side or toxic effects were noted in these studies. Furthermore, indapamide does not accumulate in the bloodstream of patients with renal impairment and is not dialyzable.
20732656	Prenatal and postpartum depression was evident in about 10% of men in the reviewed studies and was relatively higher in the 3- to 6-month postpartum period. Paternal depression also showed a moderate positive correlation with maternal depression.
11838334	Depressive symptoms occur frequently among patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), with prevalence estimates ranging from 15 to 30%. Risk ratios for first and recurrent cardiac events related to depression are comparable to well-established CAD risk factors and range from 2 to 7. The commonly atypical nature of depression in individuals with CAD plays an important role in the under diagnosis of depression in these patients. This review indicates that presence of atypical and subclinical depression, as well as of clinical major depressive disorders, significantly increase the risk of cardiac events. Pathophysiological mechanisms include altered autonomic nervous system activity, increased tendency toward blood coagulation, and elevated low-grade inflammation. Evidence suggests that depression in CAD patients does not reflect anatomical CAD severity or use of anti-ischemic medications. In addition to these pathophysiological pathways, depression affects CAD progression via adverse health behaviors such as smoking, poor compliance, and reduced exercise levels. Initial screening for depressive disorders can be accomplished using questionnaires, but structured clinical interview are preferred for definite diagnosis of depression. Optimal treatment of depression in CAD generally involves both psychological and pharmacological interventions that affect both depression and its biological correlates relevant to CAD progression.
10591380	Several interventions that modify well-documented and treatable cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors can reduce the risk of a first stroke. Good evidence for direct stroke reduction exists for hypertension treatment; using warfarin for patients after MI who have atrial fibrillation, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, or left ventricular thrombus; using 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors for patients after MI; using warfarin for patients with atrial fibrillation and specific risk factors; and performing carotid endarterectomy for patients with stenosis of at least 60%. Observational studies support the role of modifying lifestyle-related risk factors (eg, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, diet) in stroke prevention. Measures to help patients improve adherence are an important component of a stroke prevention plan.
15936634	Approximately half of the patients participated in cardiac rehabilitation after MI. Participation did not increase over time. Women and elderly persons were less likely to participate, independently of other characteristics. Participation in rehabilitation was independently associated with decreased mortality and recurrent MI, and its protective effect was stronger in more recent years.
18464331	In at-risk patients with type 2 diabetes, intensive intervention with multiple drug combinations and behavior modification had sustained beneficial effects with respect to vascular complications and on rates of death from any cause and from cardiovascular causes. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00320008.)
17975861	These data support the use of anticoagulation therapy for people aged over 75 who have atrial fibrillation, unless there are contraindications or the patient decides that the benefits are not worth the inconvenience.
17502542	Profiling the quality of outpatient CAD care using data from an EHR has significant limitations. Changes in how data are routinely recorded in an EHR are needed to improve the accuracy of this type of quality measurement. Validity testing in different settings is required.
9798767	This meta-analysis used all original articles from 1966 to June 1996 that fit the preset inclusion criteria to examine the clinical effectiveness of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices in preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism and to compare the results of knee-high sleeves to thigh-high sleeves. IPC devices decreased the relative risk of DVT by 62 per cent when compared with placebo, 47 per cent compared with graduated compression stockings, and 48 per cent compared with mini-dose heparin. IPC devices significantly decreased the relative risk of DVT compared with placebo in high-risk patients such as neurosurgery and major orthopedic surgery patients and in modest risk patients such as general surgery patients. In major orthopedic surgery patients, the incidence of DVT was similar for IPC- and warfarin-treated patients; however, IPC was significantly better than warfarin at decreasing the incidence of calf only DVT, whereas warfarin seemed to be better at decreasing proximal DVT. IPC devices are effective in decreasing the incidence of DVT in patients at moderate to high risk and are probably more efficacious than graduated compression stockings or mini-dose heparin; however, IPC devices are not protective against pulmonary embolism. The data directly comparing the various methods of compression (knee-high versus thigh-high sleeves and graded-sequential versus uniform compression) are sparse and conflicting.
9165380	This study examines the degree to which untreated anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, occurring either singly or in combination, reduce functioning and well-being among primary care patients. Adult patients were screened using the SCL-52 to identify those with clinically significant anxiety symptoms. They also completed the Rand Short-Form (SF-36) to measure self-reported patient functioning and well-being. Patients with untreated disorders were identified using the Q-DIS-III-R to diagnose six DIS-anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), simple phobia, social phobia, panic/agoraphobia, obsessive/compulsive disorder) and major depression. Of 319 patients identified, 137 (43%) had a single disorder and 182 (57%) had multiple disorders. Regression models estimated the relative effects of these disorders on health status (SF-36) by comparing patients with the disorders to patients screened as being not-anxious. Estimates of these effects were consistent with available national norms. The estimated effect of each single disorder on all subscales for physical, social and emotional functioning was negative, often as much as a 20-30 point reduction on this 100-point scale. Major depression had the greatest negative impact, followed by PTSD and panic/ agoraphobia. For patients with multiple disorders, the presence of major depression was associated with the greatest reduction in functioning status. The impact of untreated anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder on functioning was comparable to, or greater than, the effects of medical conditions such as low back pain, arthritis, diabetes and heart disease.
1985385	This article presents prediction equations for several cardiovascular disease endpoints, which are based on measurements of several known risk factors. Subjects (n = 5573) were original and offspring subjects in the Framingham Heart Study, aged 30 to 74 years, and initially free of cardiovascular disease. Equations to predict risk for the following were developed: myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD), death from CHD, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and death from cardiovascular disease. The equations demonstrated the potential importance of controlling multiple risk factors (blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, glucose intolerance, and left ventricular hypertrophy) as opposed to focusing on one single risk factor. The parametric model used was seen to have several advantages over existing standard regression models. Unlike logistic regression, it can provide predictions for different lengths of time, and probabilities can be expressed in a more straightforward way than the Cox proportional hazards model.
15265849	In this community-based cohort, the incidence of heart failure has not declined during 2 decades, but survival after onset of heart failure has increased overall, with less improvement among women and elderly persons.
10421287	Our findings support the need for a randomized comparison of preoperative and postoperative initiation of pharmacological prophylaxis of DVT. Such a trial would resolve the divergent practices for DVT prophylaxis between Europe and the North American countries, the United States and Canada, and would affect the treatment for thousands of patients on both continents.
11995656	Intensive insulin therapy to maintain blood glucose at or below 110 mg per deciliter reduces morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients in the surgical intensive care unit.
15016487	The sooner that rt-PA is given to stroke patients, the greater the benefit, especially if started within 90 min. Our results suggest a potential benefit beyond 3 h, but this potential might come with some risks.
15520049	Fewer older patients preferred CPR or life-prolonging treatments. Although older patients' goals for aggressive treatment were related to care, this was not so for middle-aged patients. Aggressive care was not related to prolonged life in either group.
1866765	The impact of nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiac failure on stroke incidence was examined in 5,070 participants in the Framingham Study after 34 years of follow-up. Compared with subjects free of these conditions, the age-adjusted incidence of stroke was more than doubled in the presence of coronary heart disease (p less than 0.001) and more than trebled in the presence of hypertension (p less than 0.001). There was a more than fourfold excess of stroke in subjects with cardiac failure (p less than 0.001) and a near fivefold excess when atrial fibrillation was present (p less than 0.001). In persons with coronary heart disease or cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation doubled the stroke risk in men and trebled the risk in women. With increasing age the effects of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiac failure on the risk of stroke became progressively weaker (p less than 0.05). Advancing age, however, did not reduce the significant impact of atrial fibrillation. For persons aged 80-89 years, atrial fibrillation was the sole cardiovascular condition to exert an independent effect on stroke incidence (p less than 0.001). The attributable risk of stroke for all cardiovascular contributors decreased with age except for atrial fibrillation, for which the attributable risk increased significantly (p less than 0.01), rising from 1.5% for those aged 50-59 years to 23.5% for those aged 80-89 years. While these findings highlight the impact of each cardiovascular condition on the risk of stroke, the data suggest that the elderly are particularly vulnerable to stroke when atrial fibrillation is present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
16934502	The medical management of patients with severe peripheral vascular disease, even where their disease has led to an amputation, is sub-optimal.
15956152	The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a working group on outcomes research in cardiovascular disease (CVD). The working group sought to provide guidance on research priorities in outcomes research related to CVD. For the purposes of this document, "outcomes research" is defined as investigative endeavors that generate knowledge to improve clinical decision making and healthcare delivery to optimize patient outcomes. The working group identified the following priority areas: (1) national surveillance projects for high-prevalence CV conditions; (2) patient-centered care; (3) translation of the best science into clinical practice; and (4) studies that place the cost of interventions in the context of their real-world effectiveness. Within each of these topics, the working group described examples of initiatives that could serve the Institute and the public. In addition, the group identified the following areas that are important to the field: (1) promotion of the use of existing data; (2) facilitation of collaborations with other federal agencies; (3) investigations into the basic science of outcomes research, with an emphasis on methodological advances; (4) strengthening of appropriate study sections with individuals who have expertise in outcomes research; and (5) expansion of opportunities to train new outcomes research investigators. The working group concluded that a dedicated investment in CV outcomes research could directly improve the care delivered in the United States.
18574268	We offer guidance for many common anticoagulation-related management problems. Most anticoagulation management questions have not been adequately studied.
16129543	The aim of this report is to establish recommendations for reviewing, reporting, and conducting research during the post-resuscitation period in hospital. It defines data that are needed for research and more specialised registries and therefore supplements the recently updated Utstein template for resuscitation registries. The updated Utstein template and the out-of-hospital "Chain of Survival" describe factors of importance for successful resuscitation up until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Several factors in the in-hospital phase after ROSC are also likely to affect the ultimate outcome of the patient. Large differences in survival to hospital discharge for patients admitted alive are reported between hospitals. Therapeutic hypothermia has been demonstrated to improve the outcome, and other factors such as blood glucose, haemodynamics, ventilatory support, etc., might also influence the result. No generally accepted, scientifically based protocol exists for the post-resuscitation period in hospital, other than general brain-oriented intensive care. There is little published information on this in-hospital phase. This statement is the result of a scientific consensus development process started as a symposium by a task force at the Utstein Abbey, Norway, in September 2003. Suggested data are defined as core and supplementary and include the following categories: pre-arrest co-morbidity and functional status, cause of death, patients' quality of life, in-hospital system factors, investigations and treatment, and physiological data at various time points during the first three days after admission. It is hoped that the publication of these recommendations will encourage research into the in-hospital post-resuscitation phase, which we propose should be included in the chain-of-survival as a fifth ring. Following these recommendations should enable better understanding of the impact of different in-hospital treatment strategies on outcome.
7482646	Fever in the first 7 days was an independent predictor of poor outcome during the first month after a stroke. No data were available on the underlying causes of fever, but the higher risk of death in the first 10 days, most frequently attributed to neurological mechanisms, suggested that high temperature was an independent component of poor prognosis and not only an epiphenomenon of other complications in the course after a stroke. In agreement with animal studies, we found that patients with higher temperature had a worse stroke outcome.
9867543	Our data suggest that diabetic patients without previous myocardial infarction have as high a risk of myocardial infarction as nondiabetic patients with previous myocardial infarction. These data provide a rationale for treating cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients as aggressively as in nondiabetic patients with prior myocardial infarction.
14758098	To appreciate more fully the overall complexity of disease among CR patients, ARSE should be supplemented not only with the inclusion of cardiac risk factors, as suggested in the current guidelines, but also with an assessment of noncardiac comorbidities.
17513578	The American Heart Association and the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation recognize that all cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention programs should contain specific core components that aim to optimize cardiovascular risk reduction, foster healthy behaviors and compliance to these behaviors, reduce disability, and promote an active lifestyle for patients with cardiovascular disease. This update to the previous statement presents current information on the evaluation, interventions, and expected outcomes in each of the core components of cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention programs, in agreement with the 2006 update of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Secondary Prevention Guidelines, including baseline patient assessment, nutritional counseling, risk factor management (lipids, blood pressure, weight, diabetes mellitus, and smoking), psychosocial interventions, and physical activity counseling and exercise training.
11345384	Current smoking is a powerful independent predictor of morbidity (recurrent heart failure and MI) and mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Quitting smoking appears to have a substantial and early effect (within two years) on decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, which is at least as large as proven drug treatments recommended in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.
11853821	Treatment with tinzaparin, at high or medium dose, within 48 h of acute ischaemic stroke did not improve functional outcome compared with aspirin. Although high-dose tinzaparin was superior in preventing deep-vein thrombosis, it was associated with a higher rate of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage.
17589284	There were significantly more participants in cardiac rehabilitation programs after 3 months in the treatment group, and this increase was seen up to 1 year after MI and CABS. There were no statistical differences, although there were fewer rehospitalizations between 3 and 6 months after MI and CABS in the treatment group compared with the standard of care group. Overall, the evidence from this study suggests that a community-based collaborative peer advisor/advanced practice nurse intervention can play a role in promoting active participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs and fewer rehospitalizations in unpartnered older adults after MI and CAGS.
2665973	Of 22 randomized trials of rehabilitation with exercise after myocardial infarction (MI), one trial had results that achieved conventional statistical significance. To determine whether or not these studies, in the aggregate, show a significant benefit of rehabilitation after myocardial infarction, we performed an overview of all randomized trials, involving 4,554 patients; we evaluated total and cardiovascular mortality, sudden death, and fatal and nonfatal reinfarction. For each endpoint, we calculated an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the trials combined. After an average of 3 years of follow-up, the ORs were significantly lower in the rehabilitation than in the comparison group: specifically, total mortality (OR = 0.80 [0.66, 0.96]), cardiovascular mortality (OR = 0.78 [0.63, 0.96]), and fatal reinfarction (OR = 0.75 [0.59, 0.95]). The OR for sudden death was significantly lower in the rehabilitation than in the comparison group at 1 year (OR = 0.63 [0.41, 0.97]). The data were compatible with a benefit at 2 (OR = 0.76 [0.54, 1.06]) and 3 years (OR = 0.92 [0.69, 1.23]), but these findings were not statistically significant. For nonfatal reinfarction, there were no significant differences between the two groups after 1 (OR = 1.09 [0.76, 1.57]), 2 (OR = 1.10 [0.82, 1.47]), or 3 years (OR = 1.09 [0.88, 1.34]) of follow-up. The observed 20% reduction in overall mortality reflects a decreased risk of cardiovascular mortality and fatal reinfarction throughout at least 3 years and a reduction in sudden death during the 1st year after infarction and possibly for 2-3 years. With respect to the independent effects of the physical exercise component of cardiac rehabilitation, the relatively small number of "exercise only" trials, combined with the possibility that they may have had a formal or informal nonexercise component precludes the possibility of reaching any definitive conclusion. To do so would require a randomized trial of sufficient size to distinguish between no effect and the most plausible effect based on the results of this overview.
8614437	Despite an increased incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, treatment with intravenous t-PA within three hours of the onset of ischemic stroke improved clinical outcome at three months.
11870250	Losartan conferred significant renal benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy, and it was generally well tolerated.
17296878	In patients with atrial fibrillation taking warfarin, the risks of death, MI, major bleeding, and stroke or SEE are related to INR control. Good INR control is important to improve patient outcomes.
7909887	Large randomised trials have demonstrated that fibrinolytic therapy can reduce mortality in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The indications for, and contraindications to, this treatment in some categories of patient are disputed, examples being late presentation, elderly patients, and those in cardiogenic shock. This overview aims to help resolve some of the remaining uncertainties. From all trials of fibrinolytic therapy versus control that randomised more than 1000 patients with suspected AMI, information was sought and checked on deaths during the first 5 weeks and on major adverse events occurring during hospitalisation. The nine trials included 58,600 patients, among whom 6177 (10.5%) deaths, 564 (1.0%) strokes, and 436 (0.7%) major non-cerebral bleeds were reported. Fibrinolytic therapy was associated with an excess of deaths during days 0-1 (especially among patients presenting more than 12 h after symptom onset, and in the elderly) but this was outweighed by a much larger benefit during days 2-35. This "early hazard" should not obscure the very clear overall survival advantage that is produced by fibrinolytic therapy. Benefit was observed among patients presenting with ST elevation or bundle-branch block (BBB)--irrespective of age, sex, blood pressure, heart rate, or previous history of myocardial infarction or diabetes--and was greater the earlier treatment began. Among the 45,000 patients presenting with ST elevation or BBB the relation between benefit and delay from symptom onset indicated highly significant absolute mortality reductions of about 30 per 1000 for those presenting within 0-6 h and of about 20 per 1000 for those presenting 7-12 h from onset, and a statistically uncertain benefit of about 10 per 1000 for those presenting at 13-18 h (with more randomised evidence needed in this latter group to assess reliably the net effects of treatment). Fibrinolytic therapy was associated with about 4 extra strokes per 1000 during days 0-1: of these, 2 were associated with early death and so were already accounted for in the overall mortality reduction, 1 was moderately or severely disabling, and 1 was not. This overview indicates that fibrinolytic therapy is beneficial in a much wider range of patients than is currently given such treatment routinely.
2633752	We tested the usefulness of aspirin (325 mg twice daily), heparin (1000 units per hour by intravenous infusion), and a combination of the two in the early management of acute unstable angina pectoris in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 479 patients. The patients entered the study as soon as possible after hospital admission (at a mean [+/- SD] of 7.9 +/- 8.0 hours after the last episode of pain), and the study was ended after 6 +/- 3 days, when definitive therapy had been selected. Major end points--refractory angina, myocardial infarction, and death--occurred in 23, 12, and 1.7 percent of the 118 patients receiving placebo, respectively. Heparin was associated with a decrease in the occurrence of refractory angina (P = 0.002). The incidence of myocardial infarction was significantly reduced in the groups receiving aspirin (3 percent; P = 0.01), heparin (0.8 percent; P less than 0.001), and aspirin plus heparin (1.6 percent, P = 0.003), and no deaths occurred in these groups. There were too few deaths overall to permit evaluation of the effect of treatment on this end point. The combination of aspirin and heparin had no greater protective effect than heparin alone but was associated with slightly more serious bleeding (3.3 vs. 1.7 percent). We conclude that in the acute phase of unstable angina, either aspirin or heparin treatment is associated with a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction, and there is a trend favoring heparin over aspirin. Heparin treatment is also associated with a reduced incidence of refractory angina.
23085864	This study shows that the miss rate for CTC is low, which means that CTC is accurate in excluding CRC in symptomatic patients at a relatively low risk of CRC.
9780339	Compared with non-smokers, smokers with mild persistent asthma are insensitive to the therapeutic effect of low dose inhaled corticosteroid treatment administered for a 12 week period. The disparity of the response between smokers and non-smokers appears to be reduced with high dose inhaled corticosteroid. These findings have important implications for the management of individuals with mild asthma who smoke.
9836671	In each of four main high risk categories of patients antiplatelet therapy was definitely protective. The percentages of patients suffering a vascular event among those allocated antiplatelet therapy versus appropriately adjusted control percentages (and mean scheduled treatment durations and net absolute benefits) were: (a) among about 20,000 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 10% antiplatelet therapy v 14% control (one month benefit about 40 vascular events avoided per 1000 patients treated (2P < 0.00001)); (b) among about 20,000 patients with a past history of myocardial infarction, 13% antiplatelet therapy v 17% control (two year benefit about 40/1000 (2P < 0.00001)); (c) among about 10,000 patients with a past history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, 18% antiplatelet therapy v 22% control (three year benefit about 40/1000 (2P < 0.00001)); (d) among about 20,000 patients with some other relevant medical history (unstable angina, stable angina, vascular surgery, angioplasty, atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, peripheral vascular disease, etc), 9% v 14% in 4000 patients with unstable angina (six month benefit about 50/1000 (2P < 0.00001)) and 6% v 8% in 16,000 other high risk patients (one year benefit about 20/1000 (2P < 0.00001)). Reductions in vascular events were about one quarter in each of these four main categories and were separately statistically significant in middle age and old age, in men and women, in hypertensive and normotensive patients, and in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Taking all high risk patients together showed reductions of about one third in non-fatal myocardial infarction, about one third in non-fatal stroke, and about one third in vascular death (each 2P < 0.00001). There was no evidence that non-vascular deaths were increased, so in each of the four main high risk categories overall mortality was significantly reduced. The most widely tested antiplatelet regimen was "medium dose" (75-325 mg/day) aspirin. Doses throughout this range seemed similarly effective (although in an acute emergency it might be prudent to use an initial dose of 160-325 mg rather than about 75 mg). There was no appreciable evidence that either a higher aspirin dose or any other antiplatelet regimen was more effective than medium dose aspirin in preventing vascular events. The optimal duration of treatment for patients with a past history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack could not be determined directly because most trials lasted only one, two, or three years (average about two years). Nevertheless, there was significant (2P < 0.0001) further benefit between the end of year 1 and the end of year 3, suggesting that longer treatment might well be more effective. Among low risk recipients of "primary prevention" a significant reduction of one third in non-fatal myocardial infarction was, however, accompanied by a non-significant increase in stroke. Furthermore, the absolute reduction in vascular events was much smaller than for high risk patients despite a much longer treatment period (4.4% antiplatelet therapy v 4.8% control; five year
19474688	Bisoprolol was associated with a significant reduction of 30-day cardiac death and nonfatal MI, while fluvastatin showed a trend for improved outcome.
8305650	The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study is randomized, multicenter, clinical trial designed to determine the effects of three levels of dietary control of protein and phosphorus and two levels of blood pressure control on the rate of decline of kidney function among persons with chronic renal disease. Study participants were assigned to one of two studies, Study A or Study B, depending on their GFR just before randomization. Within each study, participants were randomly allocated to one of two levels of blood pressure control and to one of two dietary interventions according to separate 2 x 2 factorial designs. A total of 840 men and women aged 18 to 70 were randomized. This report summarizes the demographic, biochemical, and clinical characteristics of the randomized participants at the time of entry into the trail, overviews the protocol and purposes of the baseline period before randomization, and evaluates the balance among the treatment intervention groups within Studies A and B at the time of randomization. Major indicators of renal function were found to be well balanced among the treatment groups. Selected baseline characteristics of participants in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study are compared with those of other renal clinical trials and with those of new cases of treated ESRD reported in the United States Renal Data System.
16926666	Approximately half of the 28% reduction in cardiac mortality achieved with exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may be attributed to reductions in major risk factors, particularly smoking.
10986993	Older age, higher comorbidity, higher ASA class and previous history of cardiac/thromboembolic disease were associated with an increased risk.
12052970	Influenza vaccination may protect against brain infarction by reducing infections or may identify a subgroup of patients at low risk for stroke because of a better lifestyle. These results give rise to a new hypothesis for research into stroke prevention.
9289595	Neither heparin regimen offered any clinical advantage at 6 months. The results suggest that if heparin is given in routine clinical practice, the dose should not exceed 5000 IU subcutaneously twice daily. For aspirin, the IST suggests a small but worthwhile improvement at 6 months. Taking the IST together with the comparably large Chinese Acute Stroke Trial, aspirin produces a small but real reduction of about 10 deaths or recurrent strokes per 1000 during the first few weeks. Both trials suggest that aspirin should be started as soon as possible after the onset of ischaemic stroke; previous trials have already shown that continuation of low-dose aspirin gives protection in the longer term.
19683634	None.
16644308	The chief cause of excess premature mortality among patients with schizophrenia is CHD, caused mainly by their adverse risk factor profile. Because patients with schizophrenia have less access to medical care, consume less medical care, and are less compliant with their regimens, the choice of antipsychotic drug regimens that do not further adversely affect their risk factor for CHD is a major clinical and public health challenge among patients with schizophrenia.
20842772	The combination of fenofibrate and simvastatin did not reduce the rate of fatal cardiovascular events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, as compared with simvastatin alone. These results do not support the routine use of combination therapy with fenofibrate and simvastatin to reduce cardiovascular risk in the majority of high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00000620.)
3313041	In a randomized, double-blind five-year trial, we tested the efficacy of simultaneously elevating serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and lowering levels of non-HDL cholesterol with gemfibrozil in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease in 4081 asymptomatic middle-aged men (40 to 55 years of age) with primary dyslipidemia (non-HDL cholesterol greater than or equal to 200 mg per deciliter [5.2 mmol per liter] in two consecutive pretreatment measurements). One group (2051 men) received 600 mg of gemfibrozil twice daily, and the other (2030 men) received placebo. Gemfibrozil caused a marked increase in HDL cholesterol and persistent reductions in serum levels of total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. There were minimal changes in serum lipid levels in the placebo group. The cumulative rate of cardiac end points at five years was 27.3 per 1,000 in the gemfibrozil group and 41.4 per 1,000 in the placebo group--a reduction of 34.0 percent in the incidence of coronary heart disease (95 percent confidence interval, 8.2 to 52.6; P less than 0.02; two-tailed test). The decline in incidence in the gemfibrozil group became evident in the second year and continued throughout the study. There was no difference between the groups in the total death rate, nor did the treatment influence the cancer rates. The results are in accord with two previous trials with different pharmacologic agents and indicate that modification of lipoprotein levels with gemfibrozil reduces the incidence of coronary heart disease in men with dyslipidemia.
12379168	For patients with acute coronary syndrome, lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin, 80 mg/d, reduces recurrent ischemic events in the first 16 weeks, mostly recurrent symptomatic ischemia requiring rehospitalization.
10023969	The results do not confirm a statistical benefit for alteplase. However, we believe the trend towards efficacy should be interpreted in the light of evidence from previous trials. Despite the increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage, thrombolysis with alteplase at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg in selected patients may lead to a clinically relevant improvement in outcome.
15673623	Odds of major depression are significantly increased among adults with diabetes in the presence of two or more coexisting chronic conditions, and coexistence of coronary artery disease, chronic arthritis, and stroke in particular, are associated with increased odds of major depression.
15302805	ACE inhibitors were widely underprescribed despite evidence of a favorable impact on survival in a broad range of patients with heart failure. These results emphasize the importance of ongoing efforts to translate clinical trial results into practice.
8018000	In these five randomized trials warfarin consistently decreased the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (a 68% reduction in risk) with virtually no increase in the frequency of major bleeding. Patients with atrial fibrillation younger than 65 years without a history of hypertension, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, or diabetes were at very low risk of stroke even when not treated. The efficacy of aspirin was less consistent. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of aspirin in atrial fibrillation.

19261139	Depression is commonly present in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is independently associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Screening tests for depressive symptoms should be applied to identify patients who may require further assessment and treatment. This multispecialty consensus document reviews the evidence linking depression with CHD and provides recommendations for healthcare providers for the assessment, referral, and treatment of depression.
18170999	It is unclear whether patients with nondiabetic kidney disease benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy when they are at low risk for disease progression or when they have low urinary protein excretion. With the use of a combined database from 11 randomized, clinical trials (n = 1860), a Cox proportional hazards model, based on known predictors of risk and the composite outcome kidney failure or creatinine doubling, was developed and used to stratify patients into equal-sized quartiles of risk. Outcome risk and treatment effect were examined across various risk strata. Use of this risk model for targeting ACEI therapy was also compared with a strategy based on urinary protein excretion alone. Control patients in the highest quartile of predicted risk had an annualized outcome rate of 28.7%, whereas control patients in the lowest quartile of predicted risk had an annualized outcome rate of 0.4%. Despite the extreme variation in risk, there was no variation in the degree of benefit of ACEI therapy (P = 0.93 for the treatment x risk interaction). Significant interaction was detected between baseline urine protein and ACEI therapy (P = 0.003). When patients were stratified according to their baseline urinary protein excretion, among the subgroup of patients with proteinuria > or =500 mg/d, significant treatment effect was seen across all patients with a measurable outcome risk, including those at relatively low risk (1.7% annualized risk for progression). However, there was no benefit of ACEI therapy among patients with proteinuria <500 mg/d, even among higher risk patients (control outcome rate 19.7%). Patients with nondiabetic kidney disease vary considerably in their risk for disease progression, but the treatment effect of ACEI does not vary across risk strata. Patients with proteinuria <500 mg/d do not seem to benefit, even when at relatively high risk for progression.
12691343	Venous thromboembolism is the most common preventable cause of death in surgical patients. Thromboprophylaxis, using mechanical methods to promote venous outflow from the legs and antithrombotic drugs, provides the most effective means of reducing morbidity and mortality in these patients. Despite the evidence supporting thromboprophylaxis, it remains underused because surgeons perceive that the risk of venous thromboembolism is not high enough to justify the potential hemorrhagic complications of anticoagulant use. The risk of venous thromboembolism is determined by patient characteristics and by the type of surgery that is performed. In this paper we identify the risk factors for venous thromboembolism and provide a scheme for stratifying surgical patients according to their risk. We describe the mechanism of action of the various forms of thromboprophylaxis and outline the evidence supporting thromboprophylaxis in different surgical settings. Finally, we recommend optimal forms of thromboprophylaxis in patients who undergo various types of surgery. Intermittent pneumatic compression, with or without elastic stockings, can be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients who undergo neurosurgical procedures; for patients who undergo vascular or cardiovascular procedures, long-term acetylsalicylic acid should be used for thromboprophylaxis. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or warfarin is the choice for patients with spinal cord operations and all patients with major trauma who do not have contraindications to anticoagulation should receive thromboprophylaxis with LMWH.
15834763	Frequency and clinical importance of autonomic failure in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) are discussed controversially. 141 patients with PD and 50 healthy age-matched control subjects were interviewed for symptoms of autonomic failure and their influence on daily life using a questionnaire. In PD patients, the prevalence of orthostatic dizziness, bladder dysfunction, erectile dysfunction and hyperhidrosis was significantly higher compared with controls. About 50% of PD patients rated the impact of the symptoms of autonomic failure on their daily lives as "a lot" or "very much" due to orthostatic dizziness, bladder dysfunction and constipation, which were more statistically significant than in age-matched controls. Prevalence and number of autonomic symptoms were not correlated with duration and severity of PD. In 32% of patients, impaired cardiovascular regulation was found by standardized cardiovascular function tests. If testing showed abnormal findings, orthostatic dizziness, bladder dysfunction, constipation and erectile dysfunction were significantly more frequent than in patients with normal regulation, but the impact on daily life due to these symptoms differed significantly only for bladder dysfunction between groups. It is concluded that autonomic failure is a clinically relevant, pervasive problem in PD and compromise patients' daily life activities in all stages of the disease. This underlines the necessity to adequately search for and treat these non-dopaminergic symptoms during the whole course of the disease.
19293068	Encourage men age 45 to 79 years to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in myocardial infarctions outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. (A recommendation) Encourage women age 55 to 79 years to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in ischemic strokes outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. (A recommendation) Evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of aspirin for cardiovascular disease prevention in men and women 80 years or older. (I statement) Do not encourage aspirin use for cardiovascular disease prevention in women younger than 55 years and in men younger than 45 years. (D recommendation).
19229164	An estimated 45% of U.S. adults might be at risk for developing symptomatic knee osteoarthritis during their lifetimes, with whites and blacks at equal risk for this common disabling condition. Total knee replacement (TKR) is an effective method of reducing pain and improving physical function among those with disabling knee osteoarthritis; however, whites have been more likely to undergo the procedure than blacks. As a result, a Healthy People 2010 objective calls for eliminating racial disparities in the rate of TKR among persons aged >/=65 years. To monitor progress toward achieving this objective, CDC analyzed national and state TKR rates for Medicare enrollees for the period 2000-2006, stratified by sex, age group, and black or white race. From 2000 to 2006, the TKR rate overall in the United States increased 58%, from 5.5 to 8.7 per 1,000 population, with similar increases among whites (61%) and blacks (56%). However, the TKR rate for blacks was 37% lower than the rate for whites in 2000 (3.6 versus 5.7 per 1,000 population) and 39% lower in 2006 (5.6 versus 9.2 per 1,000 population). Health-care providers and public health agencies might help reduce this disparity by widely distributing TKR information that is tailored to the education and literacy levels and culture of patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Health-care providers should conduct, as routine practice, thorough discussions regarding knee pain symptoms and loss of physical function with older patients of all races who might be candidates for TKR.
18457553	In patients who are haemodynamically stable, the RRT modality does not appear to influence important patient outcomes, and therefore the preference for CRRT over IRRT in such patients does not appear justified in the light of available evidence. CRRT was shown to achieve better haemodynamic parameters such as MAP. Future research should focus on factors such as the dose of dialysis and evaluation of newer promising hybrid technologies such as SLED. Triallists should follow the recommendations regarding clinical endpoints assessment in RCTs in ARF made by the Working Group of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative Working Group.
9167479	17,187 patients entering 417 hospitals up to 24 hours (median 5 hours) after the onset of suspected acute myocardial infarction were randomised, with placebo control, between: (i) a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 1.5 MU of streptokinase; (ii) one month of 160 mg/day enteric-coated aspirin; (iii) both active treatments; or (iv) neither. Streptokinase alone and aspirin alone each produced a highly significant reduction in 5-week vascular mortality: 791/8592 (9.2%) among patients allocated streptokinase infusion vs 1029/8595 (12.0%) among those allocated placebo infusion (odds reduction: 25% SD 4; 2p less than 0.00001); 804/8587 (9.4%) vascular deaths among patients allocated aspirin tablets vs 1016/8600 (11.8%) among those allocated placebo tablets (odds reduction: 23% SD 4; 2p less than 0.00001). The combination of streptokinase and aspirin was significantly (2p less than 0.0001) better than either agent alone. Their separate effects on vascular deaths appeared to be additive: 343/4292 (8.0%) among patients allocated both active agents vs 568/4300 (13.2%) among those allocated neither (odds reduction: 42% SD 5; 95% confidence limits 34-50%). There was evidence of benefit from each agent even for patients treated late after pain onset (odds reductions at 0-4, 5-12, and 13-24 hours: 35% SD 6, 16% SD 7, and 21% SD 12 for streptokinase alone; 25% SD 7, 21% SD 7, and 21% SD 12 for aspirin alone; and 53% SD 8, 32% SD 9, and 38% SD 15 for the combination of streptokinase and aspirin). Streptokinase was associated with an excess of bleeds requiring transfusion (0.5% vs 0.2%) and of confirmed cerebral haemorrhage (0.1% vs 0.0%), but with fewer other strokes (0.6% vs 0.8%). These "other" strokes may have included a few undiagnosed cerebral haemorrhages, but still there was no increase in total strokes (0.7% streptokinase vs 0.8% placebo infusion). Aspirin significantly reduced non-fatal reinfarction (1.0% vs 2.0%) and non-fatal stroke (0.3% vs 0.6%), and was not associated with any significant increase in cerebral haemorrhage or in bleeds requiring transfusion. An excess of non-fatal reinfarction was reported when streptokinase was used alone, but this appeared to be entirely avoided by the addition of aspirin. Those allocated the combination of streptokinase and aspirin had significantly fewer reinfarctions (1.8% vs 2.9%), strokes (0.6% vs 1.1%), and deaths (8.0% vs 13.2%) than those allocated neither. The differences in vascular and in all-cause mortality produced by streptokinase and by aspirin remain highly significant (2p less than 0.001 for each) after the median of 15 months of follow-up thus far available.
8596303	Drug therapy for hypercholesterolaemia has remained controversial mainly because of insufficient clinical trial evidence for improved survival. The present trial was designed to evaluate the effect of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin on mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). 4444 patients with angina pectoris or previous myocardial infarction and serum cholesterol 5.5-8.0 mmol/L on a lipid-lowering diet were randomised to double-blind treatment with simvastatin or placebo. Over the 5.4 years median follow-up period, simvastatin produced mean changes in total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol of -25%, -35%, and +8%, respectively, with few adverse effects. 256 patients (12%) in the placebo group died, compared with 182 (8%) in the simvastatin group. The relative risk of death in the simvastatin group was 0.70 (95% CI 0.58-0.85, p = 0.0003). The 6-year probabilities of survival in the placebo and simvastatin groups were 87.6% and 91.3%, respectively. There were 189 coronary deaths in the placebo group and 111 in the simvastatin group (relative risk 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73), while noncardiovascular causes accounted for 49 and 46 deaths, respectively. 622 patients (28%) in the placebo group and 431 (19%) in the simvastatin group had one or more major coronary events. The relative risk was 0.66 (95% CI 0.59-0.75, p < 0.00001), and the respective probabilities of escaping such events were 70.5% and 79.6%. This risk was also significantly reduced in subgroups consisting of women and patients of both sexes aged 60 or more. Other benefits of treatment included a 37% reduction (p < 0.00001) in the risk of undergoing myocardial revascularisation procedures. This study shows that long-term treatment with simvastatin is safe and improves survival in CHD patients.
10791397	Ramipril was beneficial for cardiovascular events and overt nephropathy in people with diabetes. The cardiovascular benefit was greater than that attributable to the decrease in blood pressure. This treatment represents a vasculoprotective and renoprotective effect for people with diabetes.
9843456	Diabetic patients and nondiabetic patients with impaired fasting glucose are at high risk of recurrent coronary events that can be substantially reduced by pravastatin treatment.
11280471	The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is growing at epidemic proportions in the United States and worldwide. Most alarming is the steady increase in type 2 diabetes, especially among young and obese people. An estimated 7% of the US population has diabetes, and because of the increased longevity of this population, diabetes-associated complications are expected to rise in prevalence. Foot ulcerations, infections, Charcot neuroarthropathy, and peripheral arterial disease frequently result in gangrene and lower limb amputation. Consequently, foot disorders are leading causes of hospitalization for persons with diabetes and account for billion-dollar expenditures annually in the US. Although not all foot complications can be prevented, dramatic reductions in frequency have been achieved by taking a multidisciplinary approach to patient management. Using this concept, the authors present a clinical practice guideline for diabetic foot disorders based on currently available evidence, committee consensus, and current clinical practice. The pathophysiology and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, infections, and the diabetic Charcot foot are reviewed. While these guidelines cannot and should not dictate the care of all affected patients, they provide evidence-based guidance for general patterns of practice. If these concepts are embraced and incorporated into patient management protocols, a major reduction in diabetic limb amputations is certainly an attainable goal.
10551537	In patients with severely reduced left-ventricular function, long-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor during the critical period after myocardial infarction is associated with a substantial increase in life expectancy.
12084613	A formal education and support intervention substantially reduced adverse clinical outcomes and costs for patients with HF.
7303332	The prognosis for 281 patients with cerebrovascular stroke and 44 patients with TIA is presented. These patients were registered during a prospective epidemiological survey of cerebrovascular diseases in the community of Sderhamn. There was an average population of about 32, 000 during the study period. More than 30% of the stroke patients died during the first 3 months. After 4 years the mortality was about 70% in stroke and 40% in TIA patients. The prognosis was tested towards symptoms and signs. Eleven signs were significantly correlated to adverse outcome in the stroke group, e. g. Babinski's sign present, complete extremity paresis, lowered level of consciousness, fever, tachycardia, anemia and elevated systolic blood pressure. During follow-up at intervals of 1, 2 and 3 years about 60% of the stroke survivors were at home, 20% in old age homes, and 20% in hospitals.
17975367	Current chronic wound care practices are inconsistent with evidence-based recommendations for wound management. Further studies are needed to determine the best method for translating this information to multiple settings.
11265580	The staggering amount of health-related disability associated with mental and physical conditions should be considered in establishing priorities for the allocation of health care and research resources.
8841325	Ischemic stroke associated with AF was nearly twice as likely to be fatal as non-AF stroke. Recurrence was more frequent, and functional deficits were more likely to be severe among survivors. Since stroke is usually the initial manifestation of embolism in AF, prevention is critical to reducing disability and mortality.
17196850	In spite of attempts to raise awareness about PAD as an important marker of cardiovascular risk, patients are still poorly treated prior to referral to a vascular clinic. In particular, the use of evidence-based treatments is sub-optimal, while hypertension and cigarette smoking are poorly managed. More work needs to be done to educate health professionals about the detection and optimal medical management of PAD.
17923581	CR use is relatively low among Medicare beneficiaries despite convincing evidence of its benefits and recommendations for its use by professional organizations. Use is higher after coronary artery bypass graft surgery than with acute myocardial infarctions not treated with revascularization procedures and varies dramatically by state and region of the United States.
17062587	Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia are less likely to receive some important general health checks than patients without schizophrenia.
6486020	The relation of a serum cholesterol level obtained during acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to the patient's usual baseline level is unclear. Many physicians tend to ignore cholesterol levels measured during AMI and will wait several months before obtaining a repeat cholesterol measurement; in many instances this delays interventional programs. Using the Framingham study cohort of patients, the records of all persons sustaining AMI were reviewed. Eighty-three patients were identified who had total cholesterol (TC) levels recorded within 2 years of AMI, within 24 hours of hospitalization for AMI and within 2 years after hospital discharge. In these persons, there was no statistically significant difference in the TC values measured at these 3 times. Thus, TC levels drawn within the first 24 hours of AMI accurately reflect a baseline level and can be used in instituting intervention programs.
8637376	We have shown that, in acute human stroke, an association exists between body temperature and initial stroke severity, infarct size, mortality, and outcome. Only intervention trials of hypothermic treatment can prove whether this relation is causal.
1637513	In order to study the influence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the progression of chronic nephropathy, 70 patients with a median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 15 (range, 6 to 54) mL/min/1.73 m2 were randomized in an open study to basic treatment with enalapril or conventional antihypertensive treatment. The patients were followed for at least 2 years or until they needed dialysis. The groups were comparable with respect to age and sex distribution, etiology of renal diseases, initial levels of renal function and arterial blood pressure (BP), and protein intake. The therapeutic goal was a BP of 120 to 140/80 to 90 mm Hg. The GFR, estimated by the plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA, was measured every third month, and the individual rate of progression was calculated as the slope of the GFR v time plot. In the enalapril group, the median decline in GFR was -0.20 (range, +0.18 to -7.11) mL/min/1.73 m2/month and in the control group it was -0.31 (+0.01 to -1.97) mL/min/1.73 m2/month (P less than .05). There was no significant difference in blood pressure or plasma lipid levels between the groups. Thus, the progression of moderate to severe chronic nephropathy was slower on a basic treatment with enalapril as compared to conventional antihypertensive therapy.
16935011	We demonstrated an under-use of beta-blockers in vascular surgery patients, even in high-risk patients. Perioperative beta-blocker use was independently associated with a lower risk of 1-year mortality compared to non-use, while perioperative withdrawal of beta-blocker therapy was associated with a higher 1-year mortality.
12091005	Losartan was more effective than atenolol in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as mortality from all causes in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and LVH. Losartan seems to have benefits beyond blood pressure reduction.
18772062	A progressive reduction in the benefit of intensive LLT with atorvastatin 80 mg over pravastatin 40 mg occurred in statin-nave ACS patients as baseline LDL-C declined. (Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 [PROVE IT-TIMI 22]; NCT00382460).
9068513	The APSI trial was a randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of 1 year of treatment by acebutolol in high-risk patients who had survived an acute myocardial infarction. At 1 year there was a statistically significant 48% relative reduction in total mortality (p = 0.019) in favor of acebutolol. In 1995 a long-term mortality survey was undertaken through an administrative inquiry and contacts with investigators. The vital status of 586 of the 607 (96.5%) patients enrolled was known at the cutoff date and all these patients were followed up for at least 5 years. During follow-up (in-trial and post-trial period), 74 deaths (24.8%) occurred in the acebutolol group and 96 (31.1%) in the placebo group (p = 0.10). No difference between the 2 groups was observed for the number of deaths that occurred after the end of the trial: 55 deaths (19.6%) among the 281 survivors in the acebutolol group and 59 deaths (21.7%) (p = 0.70) among the 272 survivors in the placebo group. The annual hazard rate (annual death rate), calculated year by year using the actuarial method, was significantly different (p < 0.01) only for the first year and was not significantly different thereafter. Thus, the initial benefit obtained in 1 year of treatment by acebutolol lasts for 5 years.
3176084	Two interventions for improving stroke caregiver knowledge, stabilizing family function, promoting patient adjustment, and enlisting the use of social resources after stroke were compared with routine medical and nursing care of stroke patients (n = 61) at a 440-bed Veterans Administration Medical Center. The education intervention (n = 64) consisted of classroom instruction for caregivers about basic stroke care principles. The counseling condition (n = 63) consisted of education plus seven follow-up problem-solving sessions with a social worker (for the caregiver). Six months and 1 year after the stroke, both interventions significantly improved caregiver knowledge and stabilized some aspects of family function better than routine care. Counseling was consistently more effective than education alone and resulted in better patient adjustment at 1 year. Neither intervention influenced the use of social resources.
7563451	Treatment with tPA in the 3- to 4.5-hour time-window is beneficial. It results in an increased rate of favorable outcome without adversely affecting mortality.
17139775	In patients with recent stroke or TIA and without known coronary heart disease, 80 mg of atorvastatin per day reduced the overall incidence of strokes and of cardiovascular events, despite a small increase in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00147602 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).
10591288	A multifaceted program targeted to patients whose depressive symptoms persisted 6 to 8 weeks after initiation of antidepressant medication by their primary care physician was found to significantly improve adherence to antidepressants, satisfaction with care, and depressive outcomes compared with usual care.
10789599	We reviewed the recent literature on hospital readmissions and found that most of them are believed to be caused by patient frailty and progression of chronic disease. However, from 9% to 48% of all readmissions have been judged to be preventable because they were associated with indicators of substandard care during the index hospitalization, such as poor resolution of the main problem, unstable therapy at discharge, and inadequate postdischarge care. Furthermore, randomized prospective trials have shown that 12% to 75% of all readmissions can be prevented by patient education, predischarge assessment, and domiciliary aftercare. We conclude that most readmissions seem to be caused by unmodifiable causes, and that, pending an agreed-on method to adjust for confounders, global readmission rates are not a useful indicator of quality of care. However, high readmission rates of patients with defined conditions, such as diabetes and bronchial asthma, may identify quality-of-care problems. A focus on the specific needs of such patients may lead to the creation of more responsive health care systems for the chronically ill.
20026788	Among Medicare beneficiaries, a strong dose-response relationship existed between the number of cardiac rehabilitation sessions and long-term outcomes. Attending all 36 sessions reimbursed by Medicare was associated with lower risks of death and MI at 4 years compared with attending fewer sessions.
20681048	None.
19605841	Rehospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries are prevalent and costly.
18500481	In Canada, Asian immigrants are less likely to use mental health service use than white people. More studies are needed to examine factors affecting mental health service use in Asian immigrants living in North America.
21105806	Intensive glycemic control and intensive combination treatment of dyslipidemia, but not intensive blood-pressure control, reduced the rate of progression of diabetic retinopathy. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others; ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00000620 for the ACCORD study and NCT00542178 for the ACCORD Eye study.)
22466099	With the changing CRC epidemiology, having fewer RS neoplasms but more proximal cancer, the effectiveness of FS screening for identifying significant neoplasms decreases with screenees' age and especially in females. These make FS screening less suitable for our aging and increasingly female population.
2241612	Fasting serum glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fructosamine concentrations were determined in 304 consecutive subjects admitted with acute stroke, within 48 hours of ictus. Based on the medical history and these results, subjects were divided into known diabetics, newly diagnosed diabetics, subjects with stress hyperglycemia, and nondiabetics. The type of stroke was classified as lacunar infarct, cerebral infarct, or intracerebral hemorrhage, based on clinical examination by a neurologist and computed tomographic brain scan and/or autopsy. Immediate and 3-month outcomes were examined in relation to (1) fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fructosamine levels by stroke subtypes, and (2) glucose tolerance categories by stroke subtypes. A high fasting glucose level was associated with an increased mortality, but this was observed only among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients with stress hyperglycemia, but not diabetics, had increased mortality. In spite of having similar glucose concentrations to those patients with stress hyperglycemia, diabetics did not have a worse outcome compared with nondiabetics. It is concluded that the association between glucose concentration and outcome is a reflection of stress relating to stroke severity, rather than a direct harmful effect of glucose on damaged neurons.
14603183	Each year, approximately 650,000 persons have a first heart attack in the United States. Heart attack survivors are at increased risk for recurrent heart attacks, cardiovascular complications, and sudden cardiac death. A major component of risk-reduction strategies for these patients is cardiac rehabilitation consisting of nutritional counseling; management of lipid levels, hypertension, weight, and diabetes; smoking cessation; psychosocial interventions; and physical activity counseling and exercise training. Although cardiac rehabilitation has been associated with substantially improved survival rates, the majority of eligible patients do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation. This report summarizes data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) on the prevalence of self-reported participation in cardiac rehabilitation services among persons in 19 states and the District of Columbia (DC) who have had a heart attack. The findings indicate that less than one third of these respondents have participated in cardiac rehabilitation. Including cardiac rehabilitation in all intervention plans for eligible patients with coronary heart disease remains a key strategy for reducing further disability.
21424141	In patients with atrial fibrillation, dabigatran given at a dose of 110 mg was associated with rates of stroke and systemic embolism that were similar to those associated with warfarin, as well as lower rates of major hemorrhage. Dabigatran administered at a dose of 150 mg, as compared with warfarin, was associated with lower rates of stroke and systemic embolism but similar rates of major hemorrhage. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00262600.)
9774752	A small number of clinical features that can be easily obtained on the patient's initial assessment may help clinicians to identify a subgroup of patients with cardioembolic stroke at the highest risk of developing early recurrent brain or systemic embolization.

6361299	The Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT), a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, tested the efficacy of cholesterol lowering in reducing risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in 3,806 asymptomatic middle-aged men with primary hypercholesterolemia (type II hyperlipoproteinemia). The treatment group received the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine resin and the control group received a placebo for an average of 7.4 years. Both groups followed a moderate cholesterol-lowering diet. The cholestyramine group experienced average plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reductions of 13.4% and 20.3%, respectively, which were 8.5% and 12.6% greater reductions than those obtained in the placebo group. The cholestyramine group experienced a 19% reduction in risk (p less than .05) of the primary end point--definite CHD death and/or definite nonfatal myocardial infarction--reflecting a 24% reduction in definite CHD death and a 19% reduction in nonfatal myocardial infarction. The cumulative seven-year incidence of the primary end point was 7% in the cholestyramine group v 8.6% in the placebo group. In addition, the incidence rates for new positive exercise tests, angina, and coronary bypass surgery were reduced by 25%, 20%, and 21%, respectively, in the cholestyramine group. The risk of death from all causes was only slightly and not significantly reduced in the cholestyramine group. The magnitude of this decrease (7%) was less than for CHD end points because of a greater number of violent and accidental deaths in the cholestyramine group. The LRC-CPPT findings show that reducing total cholesterol by lowering LDL-C levels can diminish the incidence of CHD morbidity and mortality in men at high risk for CHD because of raised LDL-C levels. This clinical trial provides strong evidence for a causal role for these lipids in the pathogenesis of CHD.
17483537	Depression has yet to be established as an independent risk factor for CHD because of incomplete and biased availability of adjustment for conventional risk factors and severity of coronary disease.
3735650	To determine the incidence of major cardiovascular complications in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programs, we obtained data from 167 randomly selected cardiac rehabilitation programs via mailed questionnaires and follow-up telephone calls. These 167 programs reported that 51 303 patients exercised 2 351 916 hours from January 1980 through December 1984. Twenty-one cardiac arrests (18 in which the patient was successfully resuscitated and three fatal) and eight nonfatal myocardial infarctions were reported. The incidence rates per million patient hours of exercise were 8.9 for cardiac arrests (one per 111 996 patient-hours), 3.4 for myocardial infarctions (one per 293 990 patient-hours), and 1.3 for fatalities (one per 783 972 patient-hours). There was no statistically significant difference in frequency of these events among programs of varying size or extent of electrocardiographic monitoring. These data indicate that current cardiac rehabilitation practice allows for prescribed supervised exercise by patients with cardiovascular disease to be performed at a low risk of major cardiovascular complications.
12826644	The deficits we have identified in adherence to recommended processes for basic care pose serious threats to the health of the American public. Strategies to reduce these deficits in care are warranted.
12975230	Long-term survival among patients who have undergone rapid defibrillation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is similar to that among age-, sex-, and disease-matched patients who did not have out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The quality of life among the majority of survivors is similar to that of the general population.
12390940	In euvolemic patients with symptoms at rest or on minimal exertion, the addition of carvedilol to conventional therapy ameliorates the severity of heart failure and reduces the risk of clinical deterioration, hospitalization, and other serious adverse clinical events.
15155288	As myocardial infarction (MI) hospital fatalities decline, survivors are candidates for recurrent events. However, little is known about morbidity after MI and how it may have changed over time. The authors examined the incidence of sudden cardiac death and recurrent ischemic events post-MI to test the hypothesis that it has declined over time. MIs were validated by using standardized criteria. Sudden cardiac death and recurrent ischemic events (recurrent MI or unstable angina) were identified through Olmsted County, Minnesota, community medical records and their association with time examined after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidity. Between 1979 and 1998, 2,277 MIs occurred (57% in men; mean age, 67 (standard deviation, 14) years). After 3 years, the event-free survival rate was 94% (95% confidence interval: 93, 95) for sudden cardiac death and 56% (95% confidence interval: 54, 58) for recurrent ischemic events. Both outcomes were more frequent with older age and greater comorbidity. The temporal decline in both events was of similar magnitude; for an MI occurring in 1998 versus 1979, risk of subsequent recurrent ischemic events or sudden cardiac death declined by 24% (relative risk = 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.63, 0.93). Thus, in the community, recurrent ischemic events are frequent post-MI, while sudden cardiac death is less common. Their incidence declined over time, supporting the notion that contemporary treatments effectively improve outcomes after MI.
17804969	Adherence to evidence-based interventions for hospitalized cardiovascular disease patients is not optimal. This study assesses the impact of a national quality improvement program on adherence to guidelines in these patients. Data from 92 hospitals from across the United States participating in the Get With The Guidelines program for at least 1 year for 11 acute and secondary prevention measures from a preintervention baseline period and the subsequent 4 quarters of a quality improvement intervention were analyzed. A patient group of 45,988 patients with acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, revascularization, or peripheral vascular disease was included in this evaluation. Significant improvement from baseline was seen in 10 of 11 measures by the fourth quarter: use of early aspirin for acute myocardial infarction, 76.4% to 88.0% (P < 0.0001); early beta-blocker for acute myocardial infarction, 64.4% to 79.5% (P < 0.0001); beta-blocker at discharge, 75% to 82.1% (P < 0.0001); smoking cessation counseling, 58.7% to 74.3% (P < 0.0001); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use for acute myocardial infarction, 64.5% to 69.9% (P < 0.0001); lipid treatment, 58.5% to 63.4% (P < 0.0001); lipid treatment for low-density lipoprotein > or =100 mg/dL, 60.4% to 67.0% (P < 0.0001); low-density-lipoprotein measurement, 48.8% to 53.2% (P < 0.0001); discharge blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg, 65.9% to 68.0% (P = 0.03); and referral to cardiac rehabilitation or exercise counseling, 65.0% to 88.3% (P < 0.001). Discharge aspirin use at 89.9% did not change. Statistically and clinically significant improvement in 10 of 11 quality-improvement measures for the treatment of patients hospitalized for cardiovascular disease was seen in hospitals participating in Get With The Guidelines.
19487591	Contrary to expectations, patients with greater complexity had higher odds of receiving high-quality care for hypertension. Subjective ratings of care did not vary with the presence or absence of comorbid conditions. Our findings should be reassuring to those who care for the most medically complex patients and are concerned that they will be penalized by performance measures or patient ratings of their care.
17511957	Atherothrombosis is a progressive and generalized pathologic process that affects the vascular system. Clinical manifestations of atherothrombosis depend on the affected vascular bed and include acute coronary syndromes, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Ischemia associated with atherothrombosis is highly prevalent, affecting millions of people each year. Many patients experience multiple ischemic events within the first year of an initial event. The mainstay for prevention includes risk factor management through lifestyle modification and treatment of underlying disease. Guidelines have been published for secondary prevention of atherothrombosis-related cardiovascular disease, including use of various long-term pharmacotherapies, such as antiplatelet agents, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Implementation of effective treatment strategies requires an awareness of the guidelines by physicians to ensure that both acute therapy and long-term management are addressed. This review is based on treatment guidelines and selected peer-reviewed publications identified through a MEDLINE and PubMed literature search, primarily from January 1996 to December 2006, that relate to clinical trials of antiplatelet therapy in patients with atherothrombotic disease. Secondary prevention strategies for patients with atherothrombosis are discussed, highlighting current guideline recommendations and programs designed to encourage a continuum of care from the acute to the ambulatory setting.
7664457	Depression while in the hospital after an MI is a significant predictor of 18-month post-MI cardiac mortality. Depression also significantly improves a risk-stratification model based on traditional post-MI risks, including previous MI, Killip class, and PVCs. Furthermore, the risk associated with depression is greatest among patients with > or = 10 PVCs per hour. This result is compatible with the literature suggesting an arrhythmic mechanism as the link between psychological factors and sudden cardiac death and underscores the importance of developing screening and treatment programs for post-MI depression.
7632148	beta-Blockade is associated with a decreased incidence of PMI in patients undergoing vascular surgery. Prophylactic perioperative use of beta-blockers may decrease PMI in patients requiring major vascular surgery. A prospective randomized trial of beta-blockers in these patients appears to be warranted.
7386235	In a prospective study to analyse stroke topography and outcome in diabetics and to determine the prognostic value of blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin estimation, we evaluated 176 patients with acute stroke. The patients were classified into four groups on the basis of history, fasting glucose, and glycosylated haemoglobin: euglycaemic patients with no history of diabetes, stress hyperglycaemia, newly diagnosed diabetics, and known diabetics. A high prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was shown. No difference was found in the type or site of stroke between the four groups. No difference was found in the site of symptomatic or incidental lesions on computerised axial tomography. Patients with stress hyperglycaemia and known diabetics had more severe strokes. Mortality was higher in patients with stress hyperglycaemia, newly diagnosed diabetics, and the combined diabetes groups. This increased mortality was evident in the hyperglycaemic and diabetic groups, even after excluding patients with cerebral haemorrhage. Stroke severity and mortality also increased independently with blood glucose in the euglycaemic group. We conclude that there is a correlation between admission glucose concentration, diabetes, and poor stroke outcome, which may not be attributed to stroke type or location.
18371463	Nonadherence to cardioprotective medications is common in clinical practice and associated with a broad range of adverse outcomes. These findings suggest that medication nonadherence should be a target for quality improvement interventions to maximize the outcomes of patients with CAD.
19359135	Patients and physicians often cite symptom control as one of their most important goals in cancer care. Despite this, a previous systematic review found few tools for evaluating the quality of supportive cancer management. We developed a comprehensive set of quality indicators for evaluating pain and nonpain symptom management as well as care planning needs in cancer patients. Based on the prevalence and quality-of-life data, clinician-researchers prioritized pain, psychosocial distress, dyspnea, nausea and vomiting, fatigue and anorexia, treatment-associated toxicities, and information and care planning for quality-indicator development. Using search terms and selection criteria, we identified English-language documents from Medline (1997-2007) and Internet-based searches. Based on this evidence, clinician-reviewers proposed process quality indicators. We then used the VA Health Services Research and Development (VA HSR & D) appropriateness methods to compile the ratings of a multidisciplinary, international expert panel of the validity and feasibility of each indicator. The panel judged 92 out of 133 (69%) proposed quality indicators valid and feasible (15 out of 23 pain, 5 out of 6 depression, 8 out of 11 dyspnea, 15 out of 19 nausea and vomiting, 13 out of 26 fatigue and anorexia, 23 out of 32 other treatment-associated toxicities, and 13 out of 16 information and care planning). Of the final indicators, 67 are potentially useful for inpatient and 81 for outpatient evaluation, and 26 address screening, 12 diagnostic evaluation, 20 management, and 21 follow-up. These quality indicators provide evidence-explicit tools for measuring processes critical to ensuring high-quality supportive cancer care. Research is needed to characterize adherence to recommended practices and to evaluate the use of these measures in quality improvement efforts.
8731103	A cohort of 432 ESRD (261 hemodialysis and 171 peritoneal dialysis) patients was followed prospectively for an average of 41 months. Baseline and annual demographic, clinical and echocardiographic assessments were performed, as well as serial clinical and laboratory tests measured monthly while on dialysis therapy. The average mean arterial blood pressure level during dialysis therapy was 101 +/- 11 mm Hg. After adjusting for age, diabetes and ischemic heart disease, as well as hemoglobin and serum albumin levels measured serially, each 10 mm Hg rise in mean arterial blood pressure was independently associated with: the presence of concentric LV hypertrophy (OR 1.48, P = 0.02), the change in LV mass index (beta = 5.4 g/m2, P = 0.027) and cavity volume (beta = 4.3 ml/m2, P = 0.048) on follow-up echocardiography, the development of de novo cardiac failure (RR 1.44, P = 0.007), and the development of de novo ischemic heart disease (RR 1.39, P = 0.05). The association with LV dilation was of borderline statistical significance (OR 1.48, P = 0.06). Mean arterial blood pressures greater than 106 mm Hg were associated with both echocardiographic and clinical endpoints. Paradoxically, low mean arterial blood pressure (RR 1.36 per 10 mm Hg fall, P = 0.009) was independently associated with mortality. The association of low blood pressure with mortality was a marker for having had cardiac failure prior to death. We conclude that even moderate hypertension worsens the echocardiographic and clinical outcome in ESRD patients, especially in those without previous clinical cardiac disease.
12893952	Persistent hyperglycemia on serial glucose monitoring is an independent determinant of infarct expansion and is associated with worse functional outcome. There is an urgent need to study normalization of blood glucose after stroke.
10668835	The use of grade A prophylaxis was related to the type of surgery, with the highest use seen in total hip replacement and the lowest in hip fracture repair. One in 4 patients who underwent high-risk major abdominal surgeries failed to receive any form of VTE prophylaxis. Publication of consensus statements alone may be insufficient to ensure the incorporation of important new clinical information into routine practice.
15051691	These data suggest that regular but not intermittent use of NSAIDs inhibits the clinical benefits of aspirin. Chance, bias, and confounding remain plausible alternative explanations, despite the prospective design and adjustment for covariates. Nonetheless, we believe the most plausible interpretation of the data to be that regular but not intermittent use of NSAIDs inhibits the clinical benefit of aspirin on first MI.
20451303	We present a map of 27 indicators to measure the care quality given to patients with acute coronary syndrome attended in the pre- and hospital area. This includes technical process indicators (registration of care intervals, performance of electrocardiogram, monitoring and vein access, assessment of prognostic risk, hemorrhage and in-hospital mortality, use of reperfusion techniques and performance of echocardiograph), pharmacological process indicators (platelet receptors inhibition, anticoagulation, thrombolysis, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting inhibitors and lipid lowering drugs) and outcomes indicators (quality scales of the care given and mortality).
12093424	It is concluded that depression predicts the development of CHD in initially healthy people. The stronger effect size for clinical depression compared to depressive mood points out that there might be a dose-response relationship between depression and CHD. Implications of the findings for a broader bio-psycho-social framework are discussed.
20930703	Arthritis is a large and growing public health problem in the United States, resulting in costs of $128 billion annually, and continues to be the most common cause of disability. With the aging of the U.S. population, even assuming that the prevalence of obesity and other risk factors remain unchanged, the prevalence of doctor-diagnosed arthritis and arthritis-attributable activity limitation (AAAL) is expected to increase significantly by 2030. To update previous U.S. estimates of doctor-diagnosed arthritis and AAAL, CDC analyzed National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from 2007--2009. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which found that 22.2% (49.9 million) of adults aged 18 years had self-reported doctor-diagnosed arthritis, and 9.4% (21.1 million or 42.4% of those with arthritis) had AAAL. Among persons who are obese, an age-adjusted 33.8% of women and 25.2% of men reported doctor-diagnosed arthritis. Arthritis and AAAL represent a major public health problem in the United States that can be addressed, at least in part, by implementing proven obesity prevention strategies and increasing availability of effective physical activity programs and self-management education courses in local communities.
17236251	Depression seems to be an independent risk factor for the onset of a wide range of CVDs, although this evidence is related to a high level of heterogeneity.
15341453	Among patients who have recently had an acute coronary syndrome, an intensive lipid-lowering statin regimen provides greater protection against death or major cardiovascular events than does a standard regimen. These findings indicate that such patients benefit from early and continued lowering of LDL cholesterol to levels substantially below current target levels.
2109283	At post-mortem we examined heart tissue of (i) 31 patients with uraemia not on dialysis, (ii) 42 patients on haemodialysis for less than 6 months, (iii) 60 patients on haemodialysis for more than 6 months, (iv) 16 patients after renal transplantation, and (v) 11 patients on CAPD. Patients with stenosing coronary lesions were excluded. Diffuse non-coronary intermyocardiocytic fibrosis, assessed by a score system in trichrome-stained sections, was found in 91% of chronically uraemic patients, but not in non-hypertensive, non-diabetic controls. The lesion was present even in non-dialysed uraemic patients; in dialysed patients its severity was related to the duration of dialysis; it was demonstrable even years after renal transplantation. On electron-microscopy, collagen fibres were seen, while beta 2-M amyloid was consistently absent. Logistic regression analysis showed that uraemia was a determinant of intermyocardiocytic fibrosis independent of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, anaemia, heart weight, and presence or absence of dialysis procedure.
11375373	Patients with major depression and diabetes with or without evidence of heart disease have a higher number of CVD risk factors. Interventions aimed at decreasing these risk factors may need to address treatment for major depression in order to be effective.
19841889	Targeting more-intensive glucose lowering modestly reduced major macrovascular events and increased major hypoglycaemia over 4.4 years in persons with type 2 diabetes. The analyses suggest that glucose-lowering regimens should be tailored to the individual.
10231228	The relationship between brain damage and high temperature is greater the earlier the increase in temperature occurs. However, only body temperature within the first 24 hours from stroke onset is associated with poor outcome and large cerebral infarcts.
9667723	A superiority of LMWH is suggested but heterogeneity might make generalizability to future patients questionable. A meta-analysis on individual patient data should be the next step before randomizing additional patients in future trials.
8446152	In patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, long-term administration of captopril was associated with an improvement in survival and reduced morbidity and mortality due to major cardiovascular events. These benefits were observed in patients who received thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, or beta-blockers, as well as those who did not, suggesting that treatment with captopril leads to additional improvement in outcome among selected survivors of myocardial infarction.
15523309	Stratification of patients after acute MI by a simple measure of MI size identifies populations with different long-term prognoses; patients with a QRS score > or =10 (approximately 30% of the left ventricle infarcted) at discharge have poorer outcomes in both the short- and long-term. The standard 12-lead ECG provides a simple, economical means of risk stratification at discharge.
9259673	There are two major trials of aspirin in acute ischaemic stroke. Taken together, CAST and the similarly large IST show reliably that aspirin started early in hospital produces a small but definite net benefit, with about 9 (SD 3) fewer deaths or non-fatal strokes per 1000 in the first few weeks (2p = 0.001), and with 13 (5) fewer dead or dependent per 1000 after some weeks or months of follow-up (2p < 0.01).
10680099	There is a significant trend in the attendance and completion of CR programs by older individuals, which suggests a greater awareness of patients and their physicians. The growth of the program is fueled by high-risk patients with more comorbidities who potentially are the group of patients able to obtain the greatest absolute benefit from CR.
7458515	Signs consistent with the propranolol withdrawal rebound syndrome may occur when propranolol hydrochloride administration is temporarily discontinued because of major noncardiac surgical procedures. The time course of the appearance of these signs indicates that the risk of the propranolol withdrawal rebound syndrome peaks about four to seven days after drug discontinuation. Continuation of propranolol up to the time of surgery appears safe from an anesthetic standpoint and may also help to postpone the risk of the withdrawal rebound syndrome until after oral propranolol therapy can be reinstituted.
11386271	The previously reported benefits of carvedilol with regard to morbidity and mortality in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure were also apparent in the patients with severe heart failure who were evaluated in this trial.
11113218	If the NINDS rt-PA Stroke Trial treatment protocol is followed, this analysis suggests that patients treated 0 to 90 minutes from stroke onset with rt-PA have an increased odds of improvement at 24 hours and favorable 3-month outcome compared to patients treated later than 90 minutes. No effect of OTT on intracranial hemorrhage was detected within the group treated with rt-PA, possibly due to low power.
1557097	The addition of enalapril to conventional therapy significantly reduced mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and reduced ejection fractions.
17368146	These data confirm that intravenous alteplase is safe and effective in routine clinical use when used within 3 h of stroke onset, even by centres with little previous experience of thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke. The findings should encourage wider use of thrombolytic therapy for suitable patients treated in stroke centres.
17403800	These large projected increases in demand for total hip and knee arthroplasties provide a quantitative basis for future policy decisions related to the numbers of orthopaedic surgeons needed to perform these procedures and the deployment of appropriate resources to serve this need.

10809041	Depression is common following an episode of unstable angina and is associated with an increased risk of major cardiac events during the following year.
17000937	Coaching chronically ill older patients and their caregivers to ensure that their needs are met during care transitions may reduce the rates of subsequent rehospitalization.
8126524	A formal statistical overview of all truly randomised trials was undertaken to determine whether antithrombotic therapy is effective and safe in the early treatment of patients with acute stroke. There were 15 completed randomised controlled trials of the value of early antithrombotic treatment in patients with acute stroke. The regimes tested in acute presumed or confirmed ischaemic stroke were: heparin, 10 trials with 1047 patients: oral anticoagulants, one trial with 51 patients: antiplatelet therapy, three trials with 103 patients. Heparin was tested in one trial with 46 patients with acute haemorrhagic stroke. Outcome measures were deep venous thrombosis (confirmed by I125 scanning or venography), pulmonary embolism, death from all causes, haemorrhagic transformation of cerebral infarction, level of disability in survivors. In patients with acute ischaemic stroke, allocation to heparin was associated with a highly significant 81% (SD 8, 2p < 0.00001) reduction in deep venous thrombosis detected by I125 fibrinogen scanning or venogram. Only three trials systematically identified pulmonary emboli, which occurred in 6/106 (5.7%) allocated control vs 3/132 (2.3%) allocated heparin, a non-significant 58% reduction (SD 45.7, 2p > 0.1). There were relatively few deaths in the trials in patients with presumed ischaemic stroke: 94/485 (19.4%) among patients allocated to the control group vs 79/497 (15.9%) among patients who were allocated heparin. The observed 18% (SD 16) reduction in the odds of death was not statistically significant. The least biased estimated of the effect of treatment on haemorrhagic transformation of the cerebral infarct (HTI) comes from trials where all patients were scanned at the end of treatment, irrespective of clinical deterioration; using this analysis, haemorrhagic transformation occurred in 7/102 (6.9%) control vs 8/106 (7.5%) treated, a non-significant 12% increase (SD 56, 2p > 0.1). These data cannot exclude the possibility that heparin substantially increases the risks of HTI. No data on disability in survivors could be obtained. Early heparin treatment might be associated with substantial reductions in deep venous thrombosis (and probably also pulmonary embolism) and possibly a one fifth reduction in mortality (equivalent to the avoidance of 20-40 early deaths per thousand patients treated.) However, the data were wholly inadequate on safety, particularly on the risk of haemorrhagic transformation of the infarct and on the hazards of heparin therapy in patients with known intracerebral haemorrhage. The trials of oral anticoagulants (15 deaths among 57 patients) and antiplatelet therapy (two deaths among 103 patients) were too small to be informative. Much larger randomized trials-comparing aspirin, heparin and the combination of both drugs against control-in patients with acute ischaemic stroke are justified (and several are now planned or underway).
15614334	Between 53.1% and 67.5% of patients presenting for cardiac catheterization undergo revascularization within one year. Urgent status increased the probability of PCI, and anatomy (ie, three-vessel and left main) increased the probability of CABG. Patients not undergoing proposed revascularization by one year had poorer outcomes, in contrast with those proposed for medical therapy, who had excellent outcomes.
18574265	This article concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). It describes the antithrombotic effect of the VKAs, the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity, and the clinical applications of VKA therapy and provides specific management recommendations. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs. Grade 2 recommendations suggest that the individual patient's values may lead to different choices. (For a full understanding of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendation" chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S.) Among the key recommendations in this article are the following: for dosing of VKAs, we recommend the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy, with doses between 5 mg and 10 mg for the first 1 or 2 days for most individuals, with subsequent dosing based on the international normalized ratio (INR) response (Grade 1B); we suggest against pharmacogenetic-based dosing until randomized data indicate that it is beneficial (Grade 2C); and in elderly and other patient subgroups who are debilitated or malnourished, we recommend a starting dose of < or = 5 mg (Grade 1C). The article also includes several specific recommendations for the management of patients with nontherapeutic INRs, with INRs above the therapeutic range, and with bleeding whether the INR is therapeutic or elevated. For the use of vitamin K to reverse a mildly elevated INR, we recommend oral rather than subcutaneous administration (Grade 1A). For patients with life-threatening bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage, we recommend the use of prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant factor VIIa to immediately reverse the INR (Grade 1C). For most patients who have a lupus inhibitor, we recommend a therapeutic target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1A]. We recommend that physicians who manage oral anticoagulation therapy do so in a systematic and coordinated fashion, incorporating patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, follow-up, and good patient communication of results and dose adjustments [Grade 1B]. In patients who are suitably selected and trained, patient self-testing or patient self-management of dosing are effective alternative treatment models that result in improved quality of anticoagulation management, with greater time in the therapeutic range and fewer adverse events. Patient self-monitoring or self-management, however, is a choice made by patients and physicians that depends on many factors. We suggest that such therapeutic management be implemented where suitable (Grade 2B).
8176099	Metoprolol improved hemodynamic status in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy at rest and had a more pronounced effect during exercise. These positive effects were achieved along with improved or stable myocardial metabolic data.
15383482	This chapter about treatment and prevention of stroke is part of the 7th ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), we recommend administration of i.v. tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), if treatment is initiated within 3 h of clearly defined symptom onset (Grade 1A). For patients with extensive and clearly identifiable hypodensity on CT, we recommend against thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). For unselected patients with AIS of > 3 h but < 6 h, we suggest clinicians not use i.v. tPA (Grade 2A). For patients with AIS, we recommend against streptokinase (Grade 1A) and suggest clinicians not use full-dose anticoagulation with i.v. or subcutaneous heparins or heparinoids (Grade 2B). For patients with AIS who are not receiving thrombolysis, we recommend early aspirin therapy, 160 to 325 mg qd (Grade 1A). For AIS patients with restricted mobility, we recommend prophylactic low-dose subcutaneous heparin or low molecular weight heparins or heparinoids (Grade 1A); and for patients who have contraindications to anticoagulants, we recommend use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices or elastic stockings (Grade 1C). In patients with acute intracerebral hematoma, we recommend the initial use of intermittent pneumatic compression (Grade 1C+). In patients with noncardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) [ie, atherothrombotic, lacunar or cryptogenic], we recommend treatment with an antiplatelet agent (Grade 1A) including aspirin, 50 to 325 mg qd; the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, 25 mg/200 mg bid; or clopidogrel, 75 mg qd. In these patients, we suggest use of the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, 25/200 mg bid, over aspirin (Grade 2A) and clopidogrel over aspirin (Grade 2B). For patients who are allergic to aspirin, we recommend clopidogrel (Grade 1C+). In patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent stroke or TIA, we recommend long-term oral anticoagulation (target international normalized ratio, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1A]. In patients with venous sinus thrombosis, we recommend unfractionated heparin (Grade 1B) or low molecular weight heparin (Grade 1B) over no anticoagulant therapy during the acute phase.
15383483	This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for coronary artery disease (CAD) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) acute coronary syndrome (ACS), we recommend immediate and then daily oral aspirin (Grade 1A). For patients with an aspirin allergy, we recommend immediate treatment with clopidogrel, 300-mg bolus po, followed by 75 mg/d indefinitely (Grade 1A). In all NSTE ACS patients in whom diagnostic catheterization will be delayed or when coronary bypass surgery will not occur until > 5 days, we recommend clopidogrel as bolus therapy (300 mg), followed by 75 mg/d for 9 to 12 months in addition to aspirin (Grade 1A). In NSTE ACS patients in whom angiography will take place within 24 h, we suggest beginning clopidogrel after the coronary anatomy has been determined (Grade 2A). For patients who have received clopidogrel and are scheduled for coronary bypass surgery, we recommend discontinuing clopidogrel for 5 days prior to the scheduled surgery (Grade 2A). In moderate- to high-risk patients presenting with NSTE ACS, we recommend either eptifibatide or tirofiban for initial (early) treatment in addition to treatment with aspirin and heparin (Grade 1A). For the acute treatment of NSTE ACS, we recommend low molecular weight heparins over unfractionated heparin (UFH) [Grade 1B] and UFH over no heparin therapy use with antiplatelet therapies (Grade 1A). We recommend against the direct thrombin inhibitors as routine initial antithrombin therapy (Grade 1B). For patients after myocardial infarction, after ACS, and with stable CAD, we recommend aspirin in doses from 75 to 325 mg as initial therapy and in doses of 75 to 162 mg as indefinite therapy (Grade 1A). For patients with contraindications to aspirin, we recommend long-term clopidogrel (Grade 1A). For primary prevention in patients with at least moderate risk for a coronary event, we recommend aspirin, 75 to 162 mg/d, over either no antithrombotic therapy or vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [Grade 2A]; for patients at particularly high risk of events in whom the international normalized ratio (INR) can be monitored without difficulty, we suggest low-dose VKA (target INR, 1.5) [Grade 2A].

9074574	About 60% of patients with a first episode of proximal deep-vein thrombosis develop post-thrombotic syndrome within 2 years. A sized-to-fit compression stocking reduced this rate by about 50%.
17630453	The Hospital Quality Alliance (HQA) program gives us the opportunity to systematically monitor the quality of hospital care nationwide. To gauge the importance of the HQA indicators, we examined the relationship between hospitals' performance on HQA quality indicators and mortality for Medicare enrollees admitted for acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia. We found that higher condition-specific performance on this national quality reporting program is associated with lower risk-adjusted mortality for each of the three conditions. The relationship between high HQA performance and lower risk-adjusted mortality is an important validation for this national hospital quality rating program.
24469880	Increasing the dose of ASA from 75 mg to 150 mg daily or switching ASA 75 mg to clopidogrel 75 mg daily may reduce concentrations of some inflammatory markers (in particular hsCRP, IL-6 and CD40L) in T2DM patients with HPR treated previously with 75 mg of ASA.

19244191	Prepregnancy or gestational diabetes was independently associated with perinatal depression, including new onset of postpartum depression, in our sample of low-income new mothers.
4918519	We performed a comprehensive review of the literature to determine whether or not a relationship between depression and coronary artery disease exists. Our literature search supports the following: Depression and coronary artery disease have a bidirectional relationship, i.e., coronary artery disease can cause depression and depression is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease and its complications; depression may contribute to sudden cardiac death and increase all causes of cardiac mortality; and depression contributes to unhealthy lifestyle and poor adherence to treatment. We review various pathophysiological links between depression and coronary artery disease and screening for depression in at-risk patients for coronary artery disease. We also discuss pharmacological treatments, their implications, and various behavioral treatments.
8604703	Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is present in over 70% of patients commencing dialysis. It is an independent risk factor for cardiac death, which is the cause of death in approximately 45% of patients in dialysis. The prevalence of LVH in patients earlier in the course of renal insufficiency is unknown. As part of a prospective longitudinal study evaluating the progression of comorbid diseases in patients with progressive renal disease, we evaluated LVH. In 175 consecutive patients attending a renal insufficiency clinic we obtained technically adequate echocardiograms and estimated left ventricular mass index (LVMI) using two-dimensional targeted M-mode echocardiography. We calculated LVMI using the American Society of Echocardiography cube formula method regressed to anatomic validation. The population consisted of 115 men and 60 women ranging in age from 20 to 82 years (mean age, 51.5 years). The mean creatinine was 403 +/- 207 micro mol/L (+/-SD), representing a creatinine clearance (Ccr) of 25.5 +/- 17 mL/min. Left ventricular hypertrophy was defined as LVMI greater than 131 g/m(2) in men and greater than 100 g/m(2) in women, and was present in 38.9% of the population studied. We demonstrate that the prevalence of LVH increased with progressive renal decline: 26.7% of patients with Ccr greater than 50 mL/min had LVH, 30.8% of those with Ccr between 25 and 49 mL/min had LVH, and 45.2% of patients with severe renal impairment (Ccr <25 L/min) had LVH (P = 0.05). The mean LVMI was significantly different among the three groups (97.5 g/m(2) v 114.4 g/m(2), respectively; P < 0.001). Univariate analyses revealed that age, hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure and Ccr were significantly different between the groups with and without LVH. The logistic regression model confirmed the findings of the univariate analysis: an increase in age of 5 years was associated with an increase of 3% in risk of LVH (P = 0.0094), as was an increase in systolic blood pressure of 5 mm Hg (P = 0.0018). For each 10 g/L decrease in hemoglobin, the risk of LVH increased by 6% (P = 0.0062), and for each 5 mL/min decline in Ccr the risk increased by 3% (P = 0.0168). We demonstrate the high prevalence of LVH in patients with renal insufficiency prior to the need for dialysis, which is associated with severity of renal impairment, and identify two modifiable factors (systolic blood pressure and anemia) as important predictors of LVH. We suggest that future studies should focus on interventions aimed at attenuating the impact of these factors.
16684999	Patients who have received anticoagulation therapy spend a significant proportion of their time with an INR out of the therapeutic range. Patients from community practices showed significantly worse anticoagulation control than those from anticoagulation clinics or clinical trials. This should be considered when interpreting the results of, and generalizing from, studies involving OACs.
10550192	The combined use of a clinical DVT probability assessment scheme and the D-dimer test largely avoids false negative results, has a high sensitivity and NPV, helps to reduce the costs of DVT diagnosis, and may, in the future, be useful as a preselection procedure before duplex sonography.

21546484	The aim of this updated statement is to provide comprehensive and timely evidence-based recommendations on the prevention of ischemic stroke among survivors of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Evidence-based recommendations are included for the control of risk factors, interventional approaches for atherosclerotic disease, antithrombotic treatments for cardioembolism, and the use of antiplatelet agents for noncardioembolic stroke. Further recommendations are provided for the prevention of recurrent stroke in a variety of other specific circumstances, including arterial dissections; patent foramen ovale; hyperhomocysteinemia; hypercoagulable states; sickle cell disease; cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; stroke among women, particularly with regard to pregnancy and the use of postmenopausal hormones; the use of anticoagulation after cerebral hemorrhage; and special approaches to the implementation of guidelines and their use in high-risk populations.
2237965	To elucidate the pathophysiology of intracardiac thrombus formation, serial two-dimensional echocardiographic examinations were performed on 30 consecutive patients with acute cardiogenic cerebral embolism in parallel with measurement of hematocrit and plasma levels of antithrombin III. The data from groups of patients with and without newly formed or enlarged thrombi were compared. Intracardiac thrombi were detected in eight of the 30 patients (27%), four at admission and four after admission. Enlargement of the thrombus was observed in four, and systemic embolization recurred in three of the eight. Antithrombin III levels already were low at admission in patients who later developed thrombi or had enlarged thrombi on serial examinations. When the development or enlargement of an intracardiac thrombus was detected by echocardiography, the diameter of the inferior vena cava was found to be reduced. At the same time, a decrease in antithrombin III and an increase in hematocrit were demonstrated. Intracardiac thrombi are frequently detected by repeated echocardiographic examination in patients with cerebral embolism. Dehydration seems to accelerate thrombus formation that is reflected by a decrease in antithrombin III. A low antithrombin III level at admission and/or a decrease in antithrombin III after admission may indicate the possible recurrence of embolism.
15502500	All hospitalized patients should be assessed for venous thromboembolism risk. Most acutely ill medical patients will be in the high- to very high-risk category for thrombosis. Patients who have an estimated thrombosis risk greater than bleeding risk should receive pharmacologic prophylaxis. Low-molecular weight heparin is the preferred drug-based approach over standard unfractionated heparin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in the acutely ill medical patient. Patients with higher risks for bleeding than thrombosis should receive mechanical methods of prophylaxis. Patients who have not returned to baseline health should be considered for extended venous thromboembolism prophylaxis out of the hospital.
9863810	Intensive blood-glucose control by either sulphonylureas or insulin substantially decreases the risk of microvascular complications, but not macrovascular disease, in patients with type 2 diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)
15686461	The efficacy and safety of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are related to the actual level of anticoagulation (given as the international normalized ratio, INR). It is often difficult to maintain an optimal INR over time. We assessed the clinical impact of the individual time spent within INR target range (ITTR) in 2304 consecutive patients with venous thromboembolism. Annual incidences of recurrent thromboembolism and major bleeding were 6.2% and 2.8% respectively. The relative risk (RR) of thromboembolism was 4.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.1-6.6, P < 0.001] at INR < 2.0, for major bleeding it was 6.4 (2.5-16.1, P < 0.001) at INR > 5.0, compared with INR 2.0-3.0. Patients with ITTR < 45% were at higher risk than those with ITTR > 65% (RR 2.8, 1.9-4.3, P < 0.001), while no difference was demonstrated comparing ITTR 45-65% and ITTR > 65% (RR 1.2, 0.7-1.8, P = 0.54). Annual incidences of recurrent thromboembolism were 16.0%, 4.9% and 4.6% at ITTR < 45%, 45-60% and >65% respectively. For major bleeding these were 8.7%, 2.1% and 1.9% respectively. ITTR < 37% during the first 30 treatment days was highly predictive for the total treatment time ITTR < 45% (RR 24.2, 13.5-43.1, P < 0.001). In conclusion, ITTR can be used to identify patients on VKA at risk of recurrent thromboembolism or major bleeding. Since the 30-d ITTR is highly predictive for total treatment ITTR, these patients can be identified soon after start of treatment.
8609958	Treatment with pravastatin significantly reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes without adversely affecting the risk of death from noncardiovascular causes in men with moderate hypercholesterolemia and no history of myocardial infarction.
18088347	Unstable anticoagulation was associated with hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. Method A was best associated with complications, but methods B1 and B2, in combination with time spent in range, were equally well associated. As we prefer to disentangle variability and intensity of anticoagulation, we propose to use methods B1 or B2 to reflect pure variability of oral anticoagulant therapy.
15637400	Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the United States. In the United States, the cumulative lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer for both men and women is 6%. Despite advances in the management of this disease, the 5-year survival rate in the United States in only 62%. Because only 38% of patients are diagnosed when the cancers are localized to the bowel wall, it is likely that widespread implementation of screening could significantly improve the outcome. Colorectal cancer screening is cost effective, irrespective of the methods used. In addition to currently available methods (fecal occult blood, flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, and double contrast barium enema), computed tomographic colonography (virtual colonoscopy) and stool-based molecular screening are under development. Four classes of chemopreventive compounds have demonstrated efficacy in reducing recurrent colorectal adenomas and/or cancer in randomized, controlled trials. They are selenium, calcium carbonate, hormone replacement therapy, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The mechanisms of action of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs include inhibition of the cyclooxygenase system as well as cyclooxygenase-independent effects. Considerable effort is being expended to define chemopreventive activity, optimal dose, administration schedule, and toxicity for the coxibs in adenoma recurrence prevention trials. The threshold for tolerating toxicities is very low in asymptomatic individuals at minimally increased risk for colorectal neoplasia.
19332206	Patient age and sex were independently associated with reduced rates of some, but not all, HF therapies in outpatient cardiology practices. Older women are especially at risk. Further research is needed to understand the causes and consequences of these age- and sex-related differences in care.
1360557	Clinical trials have demonstrated a prophylactic role for aspirin in myocardial infarction and in unstable angina pectoris. The Swedish Angina Pectoris Aspirin Trial (SAPAT) is the first prospective study of aspirin in stable angina. 2035 patients were randomised double-blind to treatment with aspirin 75 mg daily or placebo. All patients were treated with sotalol for control of symptoms. The median duration of follow-up was 50 months. Compared with the placebo+sotalol group, the aspirin+sotalol group had a 34% (81 vs 124 patients) reduction in primary outcome events (myocardial infarction and sudden death; 95% confidence interval 24-49%; p = 0.003) and the reduction observed in secondary outcome events (vascular events, vascular death, all cause mortality, stroke) ranged from 22% to 32%. Treatment withdrawal caused by adverse events occurred in 109 patients in the aspirin+sotalol group and 100 in patients in the placebo+sotalol group; major bleeds, including haemorrhagic stroke, occurred in 20 and 13 patients, respectively (not significant). The addition of a low dose of aspirin to sotalol treatment showed significant benefit in terms of cardiovascular events, including a significant reduction in the incidence of first myocardial infarction in patients with symptoms of stable angina pectoris.
11874298	Disease management programmes improve processes of care, reduce admissions to hospital, and enhance quality of life or functional status in patients with coronary heart disease. The programmes' impact on survival and recurrent infarctions, their cost effectiveness, and the optimal mix of components remain uncertain.
18955670	A wide variation exists in international normalized ratio control, as measured by TTR, between clinical centers and between countries, which has a major impact on the treatment benefit of OAC therapy. For centers and countries, a target threshold TTR exists (estimated between 58% and 65%) below which there appears to be little benefit of OAC over antiplatelet therapy.
1936663	We have examined the relationship between baseline variables and the incidence of new macrovascular complications amongst the 497 members of the London cohort of the WHO Multinational Study of Vascular Disease in Diabetics over a mean 8.33-year follow-up. In univariate logistic regression analysis the incidence of new ischaemic electrocardiographic abnormality was significantly associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, diabetes duration and hypertension in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, and with smoking in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. New myocardial infarction was associated with systolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol, proteinuria and smoking in patient with non-insulin-dependent diabetes; there were no significant associations among patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. All new ischaemic heart disease was associated with hypertension in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, and plasma cholesterol and smoking in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. New cerebrovascular disease was associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, ECG abnormality and hypertension. New peripheral vascular disease was associated with smoking. Multivariate analysis showed the following significant associations 1) in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes: ECG abnormality; hypertension, myocardial infarction; smoking, ischaemic heart disease; hypertension, diabetes duration and smoking, 2) in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes: ECG abnormality; smoking, myocardial infarction; serum cholesterol, proteinuria and smoking ischaemic heart disease; smoking. For new cerebrovascular disease, proteinuria and ECG abnormality were significant predictors in multivariate analysis. Patients with diabetes share many of the established risk factors for nondiabetic subjects, in addition proteinuria may be of significance in the prediction of macrovascular disease in diabetes.
19326806	Oral anticoagulation care, a common and serious condition, is in need of a program of quality measurement. This article suggests a research agenda to begin such a program. Previous research has established the evidence for anticoagulant therapy across a broad spectrum of indications and has helped to achieve consensus on the optimal target intensity for various indications. The next task will be to use this body of evidence to develop valid measures of the structure, process, and outcomes of oral anticoagulation care. Quality indicators provide a framework for quality improvement, two goals of which are to maximize the effectiveness of therapy and to minimize harm.
9759687	Despite widely disseminated, evidence-based recommendations, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is underused in Medicare patients undergoing major abdominothoracic surgery in community hospitals in Oklahoma.
16949000	AKF in ICU patients does not show an elevated incidence but does have high mortality, presenting greater seriousness when it appears after admission. However, recovery is elevated in patients who survive. The usual prognostic indexes are not exact in this patient group, the ISA and maximum SOFA being those which shows a closer relationship with mortality.
18268140	African Americans have higher reported hypertension prevalence and lower control rates than other ethnic groups in the United States. Hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control (outcomes) and potentially associated demographic, lifestyle, comorbidity, and health care access factors were examined in 5249 adult participants (3362 women and 1887 men) aged 21 to 94 years enrolled in the Jackson Heart Study. Hypertension prevalence (62.9%), awareness (87.3%), treatment (83.2%), and control (66.4%) were high. Control declined with advancing age; estimates for all of the outcomes were higher for women compared with men. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with prevalence and control. Smoking was negatively associated with awareness and treatment, particularly among men. Comorbidities (diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease), likely driven by the high rates of obesity, correlated with hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control. Lack of health insurance was marginally associated with poorer control, whereas use of preventive care was positively associated with prevalence, awareness, and treatment, particularly among men. In comparisons with the 1994-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data adjusted to Jackson Heart Study sex, age, and socioeconomic status distribution, control rates among Jackson Heart Study participants appeared to be higher than in their national counterparts and similar to that of whites. These results suggest that public health efforts to increase awareness and treatment among African Americans have been relatively effective. The Jackson Heart Study data indicate that better control rates can be achieved in this high-risk population.
16884895	These data indicate the high likelihood that metabolic disorders are untreated in patients with schizophrenia, with particularly high rates of non-treatment for hypertension and dyslipidemia. Nonwhite women may be especially vulnerable to undertreatment of dyslipidemia and diabetes compared to nonwhite men. The findings here support the need for increased attention to basic monitoring and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors in this vulnerable and often underserved psychiatric population.
16292364	In 2004, the Canadian Association of Cardiac Rehabilitation published the second edition of its Canadian Guidelines for Cardiac Rehabilitation and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention. This set of guidelines expanded on the previous emphasis on risk stratification of patients with documented coronary artery disease and the importance of vascular protection in the prevention of recurrent cardiac events. Similarly, the section on special populations in cardiac rehabilitation was expanded, and new sections on nutrition, complementary medicine, atherosclerosis, program administration, outcomes assessment, continuous quality improvement, information technology and research opportunities were added.
10543692	Metoprolol CR/XL once daily in addition to optimum standard therapy improved survival. The drug was well tolerated.
19128282	Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) overcomes many of the limitations of traditional office blood pressure (BP) measurement and is both cheaper and easier to perform than ambulatory BP monitoring. Monitors that use the oscillometric method are currently available that are accurate, reliable, easy to use, and relatively inexpensive. An increasing number of patients are using them regularly to check their BP at home, but although this has been endorsed by national and international guidelines, detailed recommendations for their use have been lacking. There is a rapidly growing literature showing that measurements taken by patients at home are often lower than readings taken in the office and closer to the average BP recorded by 24-hour ambulatory monitors, which is the BP that best predicts cardiovascular risk. Because of the larger numbers of readings that can be taken by HBPM than in the office and the elimination of the white-coat effect (the increase of BP during an office visit), home readings are more reproducible than office readings and show better correlations with measures of target organ damage. In addition, prospective studies that have used multiple home readings to express the true BP have found that home BP predicts risk better than office BP (class IIa; level of evidence A). This call-to-action article makes the following recommendations: (1) It is recommended that HBPM should become a routine component of BP measurement in the majority of patients with known or suspected hypertension; (2) Patients should be advised to purchase oscillometric monitors that measure BP on the upper arm with an appropriate cuff size and that have been shown to be accurate according to standard international protocols. They should be shown how to use them by their healthcare providers; (3) Two to 3 readings should be taken while the subject is resting in the seated position, both in the morning and at night, over a period of 1 week. A total of > or =12 readings are recommended for making clinical decisions; (4) HBPM is indicated in patients with newly diagnosed or suspected hypertension, in whom it may distinguish between white-coat and sustained hypertension. If the results are equivocal, ambulatory BP monitoring may help to establish the diagnosis; (5) In patients with prehypertension, HBPM may be useful for detecting masked hypertension; (6) HBPM is recommended for evaluating the response to any type of antihypertensive treatment and may improve adherence; (7) The target HBPM goal for treatment is <135/85 mm Hg or <130/80 mm Hg in high-risk patients; (8) HBPM is useful in the elderly, in whom both BP variability and the white-coat effect are increased; (9) HBPM is of value in patients with diabetes, in whom tight BP control is of paramount importance; (10) Other populations in whom HBPM may be beneficial include pregnant women, children, and patients with kidney disease; and (11) HBPM has the potential to improve the quality of care while reducing costs and should be reimbursed.
10029129	An advanced practice nurse-centered discharge planning and home care intervention for at-risk hospitalized elders reduced readmissions, lengthened the time between discharge and readmission, and decreased the costs of providing health care. Thus, the intervention demonstrated great potential in promoting positive outcomes for hospitalized elders at high risk for rehospitalization while reducing costs.
9183243	The addition of psychosocial treatments to standard cardiac rehabilitation regimens reduces mortality and morbidity, psychological distress, and some biological risk factors. The benefits were clearly evident during the first 2 years and were weaker thereafter. At the clinical level, it is recommended to include routinely psychosocial treatment components in cardiac rehabilitation. The findings also suggest an urgent need to identify the specific, most effective types of psychosocial interventions via controlled research.
11414629	We assessed the performance of three rapid D-dimer tests (Auto Dimertest, VIDAS and Tinaquant) in combination with a pretest clinical probability model for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in 106 consecutive outpatients with suspected DVT. Contrast venography or colour-coded duplex ultrasonography demonstrated the presence of DVT in 47 patients (14 distal DVT and 33 proximal DVT). First, we assessed the accuracy indices for different cut-off levels of the rapid D-dimer tests. Sensitivity was found to be 97.9-100%, negative predictive value (NPV) was 96.3-100%, and the exclusion rate was 24.5-31.1%. Next, the patients were grouped according to the pre-test clinical probability model in categories with low, moderate or high probability. In patients with a low pre-test probability, DVT would have been directly ruled out and the patients would not have undergone further investigations. In patients with a moderate probability, D-dimer testing and, in the case of a positive result, objective testing would have been performed and, in the case of a negative result, they would have been ruled out of having DVT. Patients with high probability would directly have undergone objective tests for DVT. The combination with the pre-test clinical probability model improved the exclusion rate (43.5-44.6%), whereas sensitivity (97.5-100%) and NPV (97.6-100%) remained roughly unchanged. The combination of rapid D-dimer tests with a pre-test clinical probability model may help to reduce unnecessary work-up in patients with suspected DVT.
17349914	Prompt restoration of blood flow is the primary treatment goal in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to optimize clinical outcomes. The ED plays a critical role in rapid triage, diagnosis, and management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and in the decision about which of the 2 recommended reperfusion options, that is, pharmacologic and mechanical (catheter-based) strategies, to undertake. Guidelines recommend percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if the medical contact-to-balloon time can be kept under 90 minutes, and timely administration of fibrinolytics if greater than 90 minutes. Most US hospitals do not have PCI facilities, which means the decision becomes whether to treat with a fibrinolytic agent, transfer, or both, followed by PCI if needed. Whichever reperfusion approach is used, successful treatment depends on the ED having an integrated and efficient protocol that is followed with haste. Protocols should be regularly reviewed to accommodate changes in clinical practice arising from ongoing clinical trials.
10587334	We randomly assigned 3164 patients with New York Heart Association class II to IV heart failure and an ejection fraction < or = 30% to double-blind treatment with either low doses (2.5 to 5.0 mg daily, n=1596) or high doses (32.5 to 35 mg daily, n=1568) of the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, for 39 to 58 months, while background therapy for heart failure was continued. When compared with the low-dose group, patients in the high-dose group had a nonsignificant 8% lower risk of death (P=0.128) but a significant 12% lower risk of death or hospitalization for any reason (P=0.002) and 24% fewer hospitalizations for heart failure (P=0.002). Dizziness and renal insufficiency was observed more frequently in the high-dose group, but the 2 groups were similar in the number of patients requiring discontinuation of the study medication. Conclusions-These findings indicate that patients with heart failure should not generally be maintained on very low doses of an ACE inhibitor (unless these are the only doses that can be tolerated) and suggest that the difference in efficacy between intermediate and high doses of an ACE inhibitor (if any) is likely to be very small.
22951452	Nearly 90% of U.S. adults with uncontrolled hypertension have a usual source of health care and insurance, representing a missed opportunity for hypertension control. Improved hypertension control will require an expanded effort and an increased focus on BP from health-care systems, clinicians, and individuals.
11485116	These findings demonstrate a significant and consistent association of diabetes complications and depressive symptoms. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to identify the pathways that mediate this association.
8596249	Intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke is effective in improving some functional measures and neurologic outcome in a defined subgroup of stroke patients with moderate to severe neurologic deficit and without extended infarct signs on the initial CT scan. However, the identification of this subgroup is difficult and depends on recognition of early major CT signs of early infarction. Therefore, since treating ineligible patients is associated with an unacceptable increase of hemorrhagic complications and death, intravenous thrombolysis cannot currently be recommended for use in an unselected population of acute ischemic stroke patients.
16534326	Preventing acute renal failure, improving clinical outcomes of the condition and attempts to hasten renal recovery have all been very attractive but difficult propositions. Recent efforts to explore the underlying pathophysiology and insight into mechanisms leading to acute renal failure have triggered investigators to evaluate novel therapeutic agents and enhance existing dialytic techniques. These hold great promise for improving patient outcomes in the near future.
12867223	In this study population, nonfasting TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels successfully identified almost all patients who did not meet ATP III guidelines for cholesterol levels. No clinically significant difference was found in diabetic or nondiabetic patients.
22308252	The iScore may be used to predict clinical response and risk of hemorrhagic complications after tPA for an acute ischemic stroke. Patients with high iScores may not have a clinically meaningful benefit from intravenous tPA at the time of carrying a higher risk of hemorrhagic complications.
1406880	Patients with proximal-vein thrombosis require initial treatment with full-dose heparin, which can safely be combined with acenocoumarol therapy.
10413387	An intervention designed specifically to meet the needs of a heterogeneous group of chronic disease patients, including those with comorbid conditions, was feasible and beneficial beyond usual care in terms of improved health behaviors and health status. It also resulted in fewer hospitalizations and days of hospitalization.
21385791	Available evidence suggests that intensive statin therapy reduces the risk of non-fatal events and may have a role in reducing mortality.
12954021	A target-driven, long-term, intensified intervention aimed at multiple risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria reduces the risk of cardiovascular and microvascular events by about 50 percent.
11397355	Early and long-term all-cause mortality and hospital readmission rates remain high and have improved little with time. The need to identify optimal management strategies for these clinically complex patients is urgent.
18813026	Symptoms of depression and anxiety affected change in exercise capacity during cardiac rehabilitation. Depressive symptoms may impair improvement in exercise capacity, thereby mitigating the cardiovascular benefit achieved by cardiac rehabilitation programs.
23040788	Risk of advanced proximal neoplasia is a function of age and gender. Women aged less than 60 to 70 years have a very low risk, particularly those with no distal adenoma. Sigmoidoscopy with or without occult blood testing may be sufficient and even preferable for screening these subgroups.
14602453	Despite advances in surgical and medical management of patients after CABG, depression is an important independent predictor of death after CABG and should be carefully monitored and treated if necessary.
14563104	Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in women and men. However, cardiovascular disease and its treatment affect women differently. Much data is emerging regarding the role that mood and anxiety disorders play in the development and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. Pharmacologic treatment of psychiatric disorders can also have direct cardiac effects. The good news is that many more studies are exploring this. However, further research is clearly needed, especially in the area of reproductive hormones and their impact on cardiac disease.
7478121	An earlier controlled trial showed that over an average of 26 months, enalapril slowed the progression of chronic renal failure. Following completion of the trial, the patients continued to receive antihypertensive treatment according to ordinary clinical criteria. All but four patients in the enalapril group remained on that drug, and two patients in the control group were switched to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. In the present study the fate of the 70 patients 44 months after termination of the trial was investigated, with a total follow-up of around 7 years. In the original enalapril group, 12 of the 35 patients (34%) were alive without renal replacement therapy versus five of the 35 patients (14%) in the control group. This difference of 20% in favour of having been in the enalapril group in the original trial was significant (P = 0.05; 95% confidence limits 0.5-39.5%). The influence of baseline proteinuria on clinical outcome was analysed. In the original control group, baseline renal clearances of albumin (Calb) and immunoglobulin G (CIgG) were significantly lower in patients surviving without renal replacement therapy at follow-up than in patients who ultimately developed end-stage renal failure (ESRF) (P < 0.05). In the original enalapril group, these baseline clearances were equal in the two renal outcome groups. In all patients, baseline Calb and CIgG were negatively correlated with the rate of change in GFR during the controlled trial (r = -0.37, P < 0.01 and r = -0.28, P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
16377369	This study shows a relationship between the severity of depression symptoms and work function, and suggests that even minor levels of depression are associated with a loss of productivity. Employers may find it beneficial to invest in effective treatments for depressed employees across the continuum of depression severity.
8992328	Carvedilol reduces the risk or death as well as the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes in patients with heart failure who are receiving treatment with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor.
19726779	Intensive glucose control in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes had no significant effect on the rates of major cardiovascular events, death, or microvascular complications with the exception of progression of albuminuria (P = 0.01) [added]. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00032487.)
15230552	The results provide evidence that an appropriately developed and implemented community-based inner-city DMP delivered by home health nurses has a positive impact on patient outcomes.
1592069	Forty-eight men with Parkinson's disease (PD) were interviewed utilizing a questionnaire which evaluated autonomic function. The study population included PD patients (mean age: 65.8 years, mean duration of PD: 8 years) and 32 elderly healthy nonparkinsonian males (mean age: 70.4 years). We found a significantly higher prevalence of the following symptoms of autonomic dysfunction in the parkinsonian patients: erectile dysfunction (60.4 vs. 37.5%), sensation of incomplete bladder emptying (41.6 vs. 15.6%), urgency (45.8 vs. 3.125%), constipation (43.9 vs. 6.25%), dysphagia (22.9 vs. 6.25%) and orthostatic dizziness (21.95 vs. 0%). Eighty-nine percent of parkinsonian patients had at least one of these autonomic symptoms, compared to 43% of control subjects (p less than 0.05). This study is the first comprehensive survey of autonomic symptomatology in PD compared to elderly healthy controls and confirms that autonomic nervous system dysfunction is a pervasive problem in PD. Erectile dysfunction is a significant problem in this patient group and contributes to deterioration in the quality of life.
9586919	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) believes that it is the oncologists' responsibility to care for their patients in a continuum that extends from the moment of diagnosis throughout the course of the illness. In addition to appropriate anticancer treatment, this includes symptom control and psychosocial support during all phases of care, including those during the last phase of life. In an effort to assure that all patients and their families have access to optimal care at the end of life, ASCO firmly believes it is essential to emphasize a humane system of cancer care based on the following principles: Cancer care is centered around the longstanding and continuous relationship between the primary oncologist or other physician with training and interest in end-of-life care and the patient; Cancer care is responsive to the patient's wishes and to the parents' wishes if the patient is a child; Cancer care is based on truthful, sensitive, empathic communication with the patient, and in the case of pediatric patients, that care is both family centered as well as child focused; and Cancer care optimizes quality of life throughout the course of an illness through meticulous attention to the myriad physical, spiritual, and psychosocial needs of the patient and family. To reach these goals, ASCO has identified numerous obstacles that hinder delivery of high-quality end-of-life care and offers recommendations for improvements. ASCO is committed to informing its membership and the public about the significant barriers to optimal care at the end of life, and advocating legislative and regulatory changes that will eliminate these barriers.
17146117	Evidence-based practice for venous ulcers may improve healing and reduce costs of care. The Association for the Advancement of Wound Care Government and Regulatory Task Force developed a content-validated venous ulcer guideline based on best available evidence supporting each aspect of venous ulcer care. After compiling all-inclusive lists of elements in venous ulcer algorithms published before August 2002, the Task Force objectively rated and summarized up to five best references from MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE literature searches covering each aspect of care. Sixteen multidisciplinary wound care professionals and educators used judgment quantification to content validate all steps. A 2004 email survey of AAWC members (N = 1,514) clarified effects of under-reimbursement on evidence-based venous practice. The Venous Ulcer Guideline containing all elements with A-level evidence plus those with a Content Validity Index >0.75 now resides on the AAWC and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality National Guideline Clearinghouse websites. However, a review of US healthcare environment components, including reimbursement policies, and the results of the survey identified many barriers to implementation of A-level evidence supported steps (sustained graduated high compression, autolytic debridement, and moist wound environments) in practice. Sufficient evidence supports improved venous ulcer care in the US but inadequate and/or inconsistent reimbursement policies impede quality evidence-based venous ulcer practice, delaying healing and increasing the burden of venous ulcers on society.
14978668	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a major cause of disability. To date, there have been no large-scale efforts to measure the quality of PD care because of a lack of quality indicators for conducting an explicit review of PD care processes. We present a set of quality indicators for PD care. Based on a structured review of the medical literature, 79 potential indicators were drafted. Through a two-round modified Delphi process, an expert panel of seven movement disorders specialists rated each indicator on criteria of validity, feasibility, impact on outcomes, room for improvement, and overall utility. Seventy-one quality indicators met validity and feasibility thresholds. Applying thresholds for impact on outcomes, room for improvement, and overall utility, a subset of 29 indicators was identified, spanning dopaminergic therapy, assessment of functional status, assessment and treatment of depression, coordination of care, and medication use. Multivariable analysis showed that overall utility ratings were driven by validity and impact on outcomes (P < 0.01). An expert panel can reach consensus on a set of highly rated quality indicators for PD care, which can be used to assess quality of PD care and guide the design of quality improvement projects.
14734591	Some injuries incurred during hospitalization pose a significant threat to patients and costs to society, but the impact of such injury is highly variable.
10523162	During 12 months of follow-up, the patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with t-PA within three hours after the onset of symptoms were more likely to have minimal or no disability, than the patients given placebo. These results indicate a sustained benefit of t-PA for such patients.
9239428	Cardiac disease is common and is the major killer in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Cardiac failure is a highly malignant condition in ESRD patients. Cardiac failure mediates most of the adverse prognostic impact of ischemic heart disease. Left ventricular (LV) abnormalities are already present at initiation of dialysis therapy in approximately 80% of patients. These abnormalities (ie, systolic dysfunction in approximately 15%, LV dilatation with preserved systolic function in 30%, concentric LV hypertrophy [LVH] in 40%) independently predict ischemic heart disease and cardiac failure, and are the largest baseline predictor of mortality after 2 years on dialysis therapy. The associations between classical risk factors (eg, hyperlipidemia, smoking, hypertension) and cardiac outcomes in ESRD are inconsistent. "Uremic" risk factors represent a nascent, but potentially important field. In our prospective 10-year study of 433 patients starting renal replacement therapy, we identified the following as major independent risk factors for cardiac disease: (1) hypertension (concentric LVH, LV dilatation, ischemic heart disease, cardiac failure, inverse relationship with mortality); (2) anemia (LV dilatation, cardiac failure, death); and (3) hypoalbuminemia (ischemic heart disease, cardiac failure, death). Transplantation dramatically improved LV abnormalities, suggesting that a uremic environment is cardiotoxic. Multiple risk factors act in concert to produce cardiac disease in ESRD; many of these are avoidable, suggesting that the enormous burden of disease can be reduced considerably.
15930428	The institution of a computer-alert program increased physicians' use of prophylaxis and markedly reduced the rates of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism among hospitalized patients at risk.
9809941	Time to reperfusion, up to 2 h, is important for survival and recovery of left ventricular function. After 2 h, recovery of left ventricular function is modest and survival is relatively independent of time to reperfusion. These data suggest that factors other than myocardial salvage may be responsible for survival benefit in patients treated with primary angioplasty after 2 h.
11034729	Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is effective in reducing cardiac deaths. It is not clear from this review whether exercise only or a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation intervention is more beneficial. The population studied in this review is still predominantly male, middle aged and low risk. Identification of the ethnic origin of the participants was seldom reported. It is possible that patients who would have benefited most from the intervention were excluded from the trials on the grounds of age, sex or co-morbidity.
20814406	Invasive disease from Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a major cause of illness and death in the United States, with an estimated 43,500 cases and 5,000 deaths among persons of all ages in 2009. This report provides updated recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (i.e., bacteremia, meningitis, or infection of other normally sterile sites) through use of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) among all adults aged >or=65 years and those adults aged 19-64 years with underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk for serious pneumococcal infection. The new recommendations include the following changes from 1997 ACIP recommendations: 1) the indications for which PPSV23 vaccination is recommended now include smoking and asthma, and 2) routine use of PPSV23 is no longer recommended for Alaska Natives or American Indians aged <65 years unless they have medical or other indications for PPSV23. ACIP recommendations for revaccination with PPSV23 among the adult patient groups at greatest risk for IPD (i.e., persons with functional or anatomic asplenia and persons with immunocompromising conditions) remain unchanged. ACIP recommendations for prevention of pneumococcal disease among infants and youths aged <or=18 years using the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and PPSV23 are published separately.
15309744	Pravastatin therapy reduced mortality from coronary heart disease and overall mortality, as compared with the rates in the placebo group, as well as the incidence of all prespecified cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina who had a broad range of initial cholesterol levels.
11304109	In patients who had preexisting vascular disease or diabetes combined with an additional cardiovascular risk factor, mild renal insufficiency significantly increased the risk for subsequent cardiovascular events. Ramipril reduced cardiovascular risk without increasing adverse effects.
18399725	Most adults treated with anti-depressants receive the medication from general medical providers. In comparison with adults treated by psychiatrists, those treated by general medical providers are less likely to meet the criteria for mood or anxiety disorders or to continue medication beyond the first month. Quality improvement initiatives in general medical settings should focus on better targeting and continuity of antidepressant medications.
9278462	Under the conditions of this study, initial subcutaneous therapy with the low-molecular-weight heparin tinzaparin appeared to be as effective and safe as intravenous unfractionated heparin in patients with acute pulmonary embolism.
9496413	More than 621 patients diagnosed with a PE have been treated with LMWH. This review included five randomized clinical trials (> 433 patients treated with LMWH) comparing LMWH with UFH. The remainder of the clinical studies were dose-response trials, noncomparative trials, or trials that included a subset of patients diagnosed with a PE. Additionally, 138 patients diagnosed with a PE were included in the group of 510 patients with venous thromboembolism and were subsequently treated with an LMWH. The data available suggest that LMWHs may be safe and effective in the treatment of submassive PE. However, the current data on LMWHs are limited by small sample size, inadequate patient description, and inadequate follow-up. The majority of studies fail to provide concurrent disease state information (e.g., renal disease), thus limiting their usefulness. The results of these trials must be confirmed in comparative studies using different LMWHs (since they may not be interchangeable) in various patient populations before LMWHs are considered to be a safe and effective alternative to UFH in the management of submassive PE.
12966115	"The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure" provides a new guideline for hypertension prevention and management. The following are the key messages(1) In persons older than 50 years, systolic blood pressure (BP) of more than 140 mm Hg is a much more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; (2) The risk of CVD, beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, doubles with each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; individuals who are normotensive at 55 years of age have a 90% lifetime risk for developing hypertension; (3) Individuals with a systolic BP of 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of 80 to 89 mm Hg should be considered as prehypertensive and require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent CVD; (4) Thiazide-type diuretics should be used in drug treatment for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes. Certain high-risk conditions are compelling indications for the initial use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); (5) Most patients with hypertension will require 2 or more antihypertensive medications to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mm Hg, or <130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease); (6) If BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above goal BP, consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 2 agents, 1 of which usually should be a thiazide-type diuretic; and (7) The most effective therapy prescribed by the most careful clinician will control hypertension only if patients are motivated. Motivation improves when patients have positive experiences with and trust in the clinician. Empathy builds trust and is a potent motivator. Finally, in presenting these guidelines, the committee recognizes that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.
12882204	The IMPACT collaborative care model appears to be feasible and significantly more effective than usual care for depression in a wide range of primary care practices.
11401607	The 2 existing classification schemes and especially a new stroke risk index, CHADS( 2), can quantify risk of stroke for patients who have AF and may aid in selection of antithrombotic therapy.
8470047	Oral anticoagulant therapy has been shown to be effective for several indications. The optimal intensity of anticoagulation for each indication, however, is largely unknown. To determine this optimal intensity, randomised clinical trials are conducted in which two target levels of anticoagulation are compared. This approach is inefficient, since the choice of the target levels will be arbitrary. Moreover, the achieved intensity is not taken into account. We propose a method to determine the optimal achieved intensity of anticoagulation. This method can be applied within a clinical trial as an "efficacy-analysis", but also on data gathered in day-to-day patient care. In this method, INR-specific incidence rates of events, either thromboembolic or hemorrhagic, are calculated. The numerator of the incidence rate is based on data on the INR at the time of the event. The denominator consists of the person-time at each INR value, summed over all patients, and is calculated from all INR measurements of all patients during the follow-up interval. This INR-specific person-time is calculated with the assumption of a linear increase or decrease between two consecutive INR determinations. Since the incidence rates may be substratified on covariates, efficient assessment of the effects of other factors (e.g. age, sex, comedication) by multivariate regression analysis becomes possible. This method allows the determination of the optimal pharmacological effects of anticoagulation, which can form a rational starting point for choosing the target levels in subsequent clinical trials.
18573855	Incorporating ethnicity, deprivation, and other clinical conditions into the QRISK2 algorithm for risk of cardiovascular disease improves the accuracy of identification of those at high risk in a nationally representative population. At the 20% threshold, QRISK2 is likely to be a more efficient and equitable tool for treatment decisions for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. As the validation was performed in a similar population to the population from which the algorithm was derived, it potentially has a "home advantage." Further validation in other populations is therefore advised.
15302643	A 50% or greater fall in the platelet count from the postoperative peak is a sensitive definition indicating possible HIT that is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis.
15718176	Many patients had low levels of knowledge and lacked a clear understanding of heart failure and self-care. Educational interventions need to be designed specifically for elderly patients and need to target barriers to learning such as functional and cognitive limitations, misconceptions, low motivation and self-esteem. Health care professionals need to be skilled in assessing the requirements and level of education given to the individual. New technologies such as computer-based education and telemonitoring can be used as tools to improve the education. Patient education is an important component of heart failure care and should be provided through effective and well-evaluated strategies.
8651103	Measurement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol during acute myocardial infarction in nonfasting patients on initial presentation to an emergency room by any of 3 methods (ultracentrifugation, immunoseparation, or the Friedewald estimate), identifies patients eligible for antilipemic interventions. Although slightly less sensitive, the conventional Friedewald estimate of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels provides clinicians good correlation with ultracentrifugation.
10459932	Beta-blocker therapy had benefits for survival in stable heart-failure patients. Results should not, however, be extrapolated to patients with severe class IV symptoms and recent instability because safety and efficacy has not been established in these patients.
9121190	Pulmonary embolism after ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke may defy antemortem diagnosis in half of the affected patients. Pulmonary embolism in patients with acute stroke can be a cause of early mortality (during the first month after the ictus).
8630840	No similar consensus statements or practice guidelines for thrombolytic therapy in Canada are available for comparison.
16269630	Data suggest that patients are selectively screened based on stroke severity. Pneumonia rate was higher in US patients compared with S/P patients. Clinical judgment regarding who should be screened is imperfect. S/P patients have a lower pneumonia rate indicating that DS adds accuracy in predicting pneumonia risk. The Joint Commission recently retired DS as a performance indicator for Primary Stroke Center certification. These results suggest the need to implement a DS performance measure for patients with acute stroke.
18187060	CT colonography has a reasonable sensitivity and specificity for detecting large polyps but was less accurate than endoscopic colonoscopy for smaller polyps. Thus, CT colonography may not be a reasonable alternative in situations in which a small polyp may be clinically relevant.
17684181	Currently available clinical data do not support the routine, long-term use of aspirin dosages greater than 75 to 81 mg/d in the setting of cardiovascular disease prevention. Higher dosages, which may be commonly prescribed, do not better prevent events but are associated with increased risks of gastrointestinal bleeding.
16775884	The differences among sociodemographic subgroups in the observed quality of health care are small in comparison with the gap for each subgroup between observed and desirable quality of health care. Quality-improvement programs that focus solely on reducing disparities among sociodemographic subgroups may miss larger opportunities to improve care.
72286	Cerebral blood-flow (C.B.F.) was measured in 38 patients with haematocrit values (Hct) in the range 0-47--0-53 and was found to be significantly lower than in 43 patients with Hct in a lower range (0-36--0-46). After reduction of Hct in the higher Hct group by venesection, flow increased by a mean of 50%. This improvement in flow was largely due to a reduction in viscosity. Hct around the generally accepted upper limit of normal may be an important factor in the causation of occlusive vascular disease.
8439222	The year 1991 marked the 50th anniversary of the first clinical use of oral anticoagulant therapy as a means of preventing thromboembolic disease. Despite long-term physician familiarity with oral anticoagulants, this mode of therapy still suffers from a relatively high-risk/safety profile. This review briefly highlights important historical and pharmacokinetic points of interest but focuses predominantly on aspects of the day-to-day management of anticoagulant therapy aiming to enhance physician performance in this therapeutic milieu. Emphasis is placed on therapeutic monitoring, understanding the prothrombin time, managing complications, and assessing future innovations for the management of a growing population of patients treated with orally administered anticoagulants.
21788621	The AAN has adapted a measure development process that is suitable for national measurement programs and has demonstrated its capability to independently develop quality measures.
14610159	Valsartan is as effective as captopril in patients who are at high risk for cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction. Combining valsartan with captopril increased the rate of adverse events without improving survival.
11845640	Although the literature specifically addressing low health literacy in patients with heart failure is limited, it is consistent with the larger body of health literacy evidence. Timely recognition of low health literacy combined with tailored interventions should be integrated into clinical practice.
9161057	SMRs based on in-hospital and 30-day mortality were relatively similar, although classification of hospitals as statistical outliers often differed. However, there was no evidence that in-hospital SMRs were biased by differences in post-discharge mortality or discharge practices.
19008692	As some of the identified system-level factors can be altered by public and hospital-level policy, study results suggest opportunities for interventions and directions for future research that could increase the use of CR.
11386934	Ramipril, compared with amlodipine, retards renal disease progression in patients with hypertensive renal disease and proteinuria and may offer benefit to patients without proteinuria.
19070734	In people at high vascular risk, telmisartan's effects on major renal outcomes are similar to ramipril. Although combination therapy reduces proteinuria to a greater extent than monotherapy, overall it worsens major renal outcomes.
17848919	Atypical antipsychotic drugs offer several notable benefits over typical antipsychotics, including greater improvement in negative symptoms, cognitive function, prevention of deterioration, and quality of life, and fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). However, concerns about EPS have been replaced by concerns about other side effects, such as weight gain, glucose dysregulation and dyslipidemia. These side effects are associated with potential long-term cardiovascular health risks, decreased medication adherence, and may eventually lead to clinical deterioration. Despite a greater understanding of the biochemical effects of these drugs in recent years, the pharmacological mechanisms underlying their various therapeutic properties and related side effects remain unclear. Besides dopamine D(2) receptor antagonism, a characteristic feature of all atypical antipsychotic drugs, these agents also bind to a range of non-dopaminergic targets, including serotonin, glutamate, histamine, alpha-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. This review examines the potential contribution of different receptors to metabolic side effects associated with atypical antipsychotic treatment for all seven agents currently marketed in the United States (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, paliperidone and clozapine) and another agent (bifeprunox) in clinical development at the time of this publication.
9024396	Long-term administration of clopidogrel to patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease is more effective than aspirin in reducing the combined risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. The overall safety profile of clopidogrel is at least as good as that of medium-dose aspirin.
12573393	Pravastatin given for 3 years reduced the risk of coronary disease in elderly individuals. PROSPER therefore extends to elderly individuals the treatment strategy currently used in middle aged people.
12813119	A majority of the LPT costs that employers face from employee depression is invisible and explained by reduced performance while at work. Use of treatments for depression appears to be relatively low. The combined LPT burden among those with depression and the low level of treatment suggests that there may be cost-effective opportunities for improving depression-related outcomes in the US workforce.
11308400	The additional predictive value of DSE is limited in clinically low-risk patients receiving beta-blockers. In clinical practice, DSE may be avoided in a large number of patients who can proceed safely for surgery without delay. In clinically intermediate- and high-risk patients receiving beta-blockers, DSE may help identify those in whom surgery can still be performed and those in whom cardiac revascularization should be considered.
21474809	earlier and more intensive mobilization after stroke may fast-track return to unassisted walking and improve functional recovery. Clinical Trial Registration- This trial was not registered because enrollment began before July 2005.
18270349	The prevalence of CKD in the United States in 1999-2004 is higher than it was in 1988-1994. This increase is partly explained by the increasing prevalence of diabetes and hypertension and raises concerns about future increased incidence of kidney failure and other complications of CKD.
20130401	We have demonstrated the feasibility of implementing EM and AM for physiological complications in a randomised controlled trial. Larger trials are warranted to determine whether these interventions have clinical benefits.
2342250	Hypertension is associated with an accelerated rate of decline in renal function in patients with chronic renal disease. To identify factors that might alter the rate of decline in renal function, we reviewed records of 200 patients from the Nephrology Clinic of the Durham VA Medical Center who had chronic progressive renal insufficiency. The average rate of decline in renal function (slope of reciprocal plasma creatinine versus time) was -0.80 +/- 0.62 (SD) ml/mg month in 112 black patients and -0.84 +/- 0.59 in 88 white patients. Multiple regression analysis indicates that the patient's age, level of diastolic blood pressure and type of antihypertensive treatment had a significant effect on the slope of reciprocal creatinine whereas the patient's race and diagnosis did not. In individual patients, addition of minoxidil or a calcium channel blocker to other medications significantly lowered blood pressure and slope of reciprocal creatinine. Some antihypertensive medications lowered blood pressure without significantly affecting the slope. These data suggest that specific medications may have a favorable effect on the progression of chronic renal disease by mechanisms in addition to reduction of blood pressure.
12379169	Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.
17190966	1. Early falls, poor response to levodopa, symmetry of motor manifestations, lack of tremor, and early autonomic dysfunction are probably useful in distinguishing other parkinsonian syndromes from Parkinson disease (PD). 2. Levodopa or apomorphine challenge and olfactory testing are probably useful in distinguishing PD from other parkinsonian syndromes. 3. Predictive factors for more rapid motor progression, nursing home placement, and shorter survival time include older age at onset of PD, associated comorbidities, presentation with rigidity and bradykinesia, and decreased dopamine responsiveness. Future research into methods for earlier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease and identification and clarification of predictive factors of rapid disease progression is warranted.
19707118	After adjustment for confounders, discontinuation of beta-blocker prescription during the first week after surgery was significantly associated with POMI and death. These findings confirm the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Care for Noncardiac Surgery, which recommend not to withdraw beta-blocker therapy.
9952195	Lovastatin reduces the risk for the first acute major coronary event in men and women with average TC and LDL-C levels and below-average HDL-C levels. These findings support the inclusion of HDL-C in risk-factor assessment, confirm the benefit of LDL-C reduction to a target goal, and suggest the need for reassessment of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines regarding pharmacological intervention.
12395027	A program to prevent depression relapse in primary care yields modest increases in days free of depression and modest increases in treatment costs. These modest differences reflect high rates of treatment in usual care. Along with other recent studies, these findings suggest that improved care of depression in primary care is a prudent investment of health care resources.
1972470	There are 14 unconfounded randomised trials of antihypertensive drugs (chiefly diuretics or beta-blockers): total 37,000 individuals, mean treatment duration 5 years, mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) difference 5-6 mm Hg. In prospective observational studies, a long-term difference of 5-6 mm Hg in usual DBP is associated with about 35-40% less stroke and 20-25% less coronary heart disease (CHD). For those dying in the trials, the DBP difference had persisted only 2-3 years, yet an overview showed that vascular mortality was significantly reduced (2p less than 0.0002); non-vascular mortality appeared unchanged. Stroke was reduced by 42% SD 6 (95% confidence interval 35-50%; 289 vs 484 events, 2p less than 0.0001), suggesting that virtually all the epidemiologically expected stroke reduction appears rapidly. CHD was reduced by 14% SD 5 (95% CI 4-22%; 671 vs 771 events, 2p less than 0.01), suggesting that just over half the epidemiologically expected CHD reduction appears rapidly. Although this significant CHD reduction could well be worthwhile, its size remains indefinite for most circumstances (though beta-blockers after myocardial infarction are of substantial benefit). At present, therefore, a sufficiently high risk of stroke (perhaps because of age, blood pressure, or, in particular, history of cerebrovascular disease) may be the clearest indication for antihypertensive treatment.
10657414	The results from this meta-analysis suggest that pyrexia after stroke onset is associated with a marked increase in morbidity and mortality. Measures should be taken to combat fever in the clinical setting to prevent stroke progression. The possible benefit of therapeutic hypothermia in the management of acute stroke should be further investigated.
15199026	Comprehensive discharge planning plus postdischarge support for older patients with CHF significantly reduced readmission rates and may improve health outcomes such as survival and QOL without increasing costs.
15057314	The crude rate of cardiac catheterization in Canada increased from 359.9 to 471.5 per 100,000 population across the five years studied. There was considerable variation in revascularization procedure rates across health regions and provinces. Between 1997/1998 and 1999/2000, there was little increase in the rate of CABGs performed in Canada but a marked increase in the rate of PCIs. For both CABG and PCI, rates were higher for men than women, and highest in the 65- to 74-year-old age category. This study provides a valuable 'snapshot' of cardiac procedure use rates but indicates a clear need for more comprehensive collection of cardiac care data in Canada.
15026401	Our findings suggest that home BP measurement has a better prognostic accuracy than office BP measurement. Blood pressure should systematically be measured at home in patients receiving treatment for hypertension.
19633243	In this sample of outpatients with coronary heart disease, the association between depressive symptoms and adverse cardiovascular events was largely explained by behavioral factors, particularly physical inactivity.
3537064	The clinical diagnosis of venous thrombosis is inaccurate because the clinical findings are both insensitive and nonspecific. The sensitivity of clinical diagnosis is low because many potentially dangerous venous thrombi are clinically silent. The specificity of clinical diagnosis is low because the symptoms or signs of venous thrombosis all can be caused by nonthrombotic disorders. For these reasons, a practical approach for the diagnosis of venous thrombosis is important. A current approach to the diagnosis of clinically suspected venous thrombosis favors the use of impedance plethysmography over Doppler ultrasonography as the main test for this disorder. This is because impedance plethysmography is precise and objective, whereas the interpretation of Doppler ultrasonography is subjective and requires considerable skill and experience to form reliable diagnoses. The use of serial impedance plethysmography has been evaluated recently in a prospective study. The rationale of repeated impedance plethysmography evaluation is based on the premise that calf vein thrombi are only clinically important when they extend into the proximal veins, at which point detection with impedance plethysmography is possible. Therefore, by performing repeated examinations with impedance plethysmography in patients with clinically suspected venous thrombosis, it is possible to identify patients with extending calf vein thrombosis who can be treated appropriately. Impedance plethysmography is performed immediately on referral; if it is positive in the absence of clinical conditions that are known to produce falsely positive results, the diagnosis of venous thrombosis is established, and the patient is treated accordingly. If the result of the initial impedance plethysmography evaluation is negative, anticoagulant therapy is withheld, and impedance plethysmography is repeated the following day, again on day 5 to 7 and on day 10 to 14. If impedance plethysmography becomes positive during this time, a diagnosis of venous thrombosis is made and anticoagulant therapy is commenced. Positive impedance plethysmography in the presence of conditions known to produce a false positive result (for example, congestive cardiac failure) should be confirmed by venography. If noninvasive tests for the diagnosis of venous thrombosis are not available, a clinical suspicion of venous thrombosis should be objectively confirmed or excluded by performing ascending venography.
