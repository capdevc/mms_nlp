NQMC-8630	The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Child Version provides information on parents' experience with their child's practice. Results summarize patient experiences through an overall rating question, composites and individual question summary rates.  For this "Communication" measure, parents or guardians reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their child's provider communicated well. The "Communication" composite measure is based on six questions in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Child Version:         Q26: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider explain things about your child's health in a way that was easy to understand?       Q27: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider listen carefully to you?       Q29: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider give you easy to understand information about these health questions or concerns?       Q30: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider seem to know the important information about your child's medical history?       Q31: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider show respect for what you had to say?       Q32: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider spend enough time with your child?   The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. The number of "Never" or "Sometimes," "Usually," and "Always" responses on the "Communication" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)  Eligible patients whose parent or guardian answered the "Communication" questions on the CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Child Version (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-3177	This measure assesses the mean score for the questions in the "Tests and Treatments" section of the Inpatient Survey.    The "Tests and Treatments" section is one of ten sections that comprise the Inpatient Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century).

The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).      Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).

NQMC-849	This single-item measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") someone talked to them about including family or friends in their counseling or treatment.Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.  The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies. This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:        To satisfy external standards.       To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.       To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.       To hold providers accountable through public reporting.    The number of health plan members from the denominator who indicated "Yes" or "No" regarding whether someone talked to them about including family or friends in their counseling or treatment Health plan members age 18 years and older, enrolled in a managed care organization (MCO) or managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) for the previous 12 months with no more than one break in enrollment of up to 45 days during the enrollment period, who received behavioral health care services and who answered the "Including Family and Friends in Treatment" question on the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey
NQMC-2067	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adult patients who reported how often they felt they would get in trouble if they disagreed with or complained about their substance use counselors.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Outpatient Substance Use Treatment Module.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction    Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall.

NQMC-4541	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who indicated how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their child:        Got care as soon as they needed when they were sick or injured       Got an appointment as soon as they needed when they weren't sick or injured     The "Getting Care Quickly" composite measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 4.0 (Child Questionnaire).  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care. The CAHPS consortium began by developing the CAHPS Health Plan Survey, an integrated set of carefully tested and standardized questionnaires and report formats that can be used to produce meaningful, reliable, and comparable information about the experiences of consumers enrolled in health plans.    The CAHPS Health Plan Survey is designed to generate information that consumers can use to choose health plans, that purchasers can use to assess the value of services they buy, and that health plans can use to assess their performance and improve their products and services. As AHRQ had intended, the survey can be used with all types of health insurance consumers--including Medicaid recipients, Medicare beneficiaries, and those who are commercially insured--and across the full range of health care delivery systems, from fee-for-service to managed care plans. The instruments also capture information about special groups, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities and families with children.    The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires health plans to submit measures from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey as part of their HEDIS submission and for accreditation purposes.

NQMC-8620	The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Adult Version provides information on patients' experience with practices and gives a general indication of how well a practice meets patient expectations. Results summarize patient experience with care through an overall rating question, composites and question summary rates.   For this "Self-Management Support" measure, adult patients reported whether ("Yes" or "No") they received self-management support. The "Self-Management Support" composite measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Adult Version:        Q35: In the last 12 months, did anyone in this provider's office talk with you about specific goals for your health?       Q36: In the last 12 months, did anyone in this provider's office ask you if there are things that make it hard for you to take care of your health?   The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome.

NQMC-8609	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult inpatients who reported how often the hospital staff was responsive to their needs.  The "Responsiveness of Hospital Staff" composite measure is based on two questions on the CAHPS Hospital Survey. One question asks patients ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always," "I never pressed the call button"):        During this hospital stay, after you pressed the call button, how often did you get help as soon as you wanted it?     AND  One question asks patients ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always"):        How often did you get help in getting to the bathroom or in using a bedpan as soon as you wanted?     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey is part of a larger Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) program sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). CAHPS was initiated by AHRQ in 1995 to establish survey and reporting products that provide consumers with information on health plan and provider performance. Since 1995, the initiative has grown to include a range of health care services at multiple levels of the delivery system. HCAHPS was developed by AHRQ in response to the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services' (CMS) request for a survey that supports the assessment of patients' perspectives on hospital care.   The purpose of HCAHPS is to uniformly measure and publicly report patients' perspectives on their inpatient care. While many hospitals collected information on patients' satisfaction with care, there was no national standard for collecting this information that would yield valid comparisons across all hospitals. HCAHPS represents the first national standard for the collection of information on patients' perspectives about their inpatient care.  Three broad goals have shaped the HCAHPS survey. First, the survey is designed to produce comparable data on patients' perspectives of care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between hospitals on domains that are important to consumers. Second, public reporting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care. Third, public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of hospital care provided in return for the public investment. With these goals in mind, the HCAHPS project has taken substantial steps to assure that the survey is credible, useful, and practical. This methodology and the information it generates is made available to the public. The number of ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always," or "I never pressed the call button") responses on the "Responsiveness of Hospital Staff" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Hospital inpatients with an admission during the reporting period who answered the "Responsiveness of Hospital Staff" questions on the CAHPS Hospital Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-4544	This measure is used to assess parents' or guardians' perceptions of all the health care their child received from their health plan. Parents rate their child's care on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst health care possible and 10 is the best health care possible. Responses are grouped by rating: percentages are reported for ratings of 9 and 10, 7 and 8, and 6 and lower.    Note: The percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 (or sometimes 8, 9, and 10) is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care.

NQMC-7396	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who indicated whether ("Yes or "No") their family member's basic needs were met.  This "Meeting Basic Needs: Help with Eating, Drinking, and Toileting" composite measure is based on three questions in the CAHPS Nursing Home Family Member Survey that asks respondents (defined as family members of nursing home residents) whether the resident was made to:        Wait too long for help with eating       Wait too long for help with drinking       Wait too long for help with toileting     The Family Member Survey asks respondents to report on their own experiences (not the resident's) with the nursing home and their perceptions of the quality of care provided to a family member living in a nursing home. This instrument is designed to be administered by mail.   Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level (nursing home) reporting.The CAHPS Nursing Home Surveys include three instruments designed to provide information on the experiences of nursing home residents and their family members. Multiple versions of the Nursing Home Surveys are available to meet different needs:        Long-Stay Resident Survey       Discharged Resident       Family Member Survey     The Nursing Home Surveys can be used in monitoring programs designed to improve both care quality and patient satisfaction.  Although the family members do not receive care from the nursing home, their experiences at the nursing home and with staff are important in describing the quality of the nursing home. Family members often help choose the nursing home and continue to be involved with their family member after entry, participating in care planning and making decisions on behalf of the resident. Like the CAHPS Nursing Home Resident Surveys, the family reported experiences of care complement other, publicly reported data such as health deficiencies, staffing, and other quality indicators (e.g., percent of residents with restraints), and thus contribute to providing a comprehensive view of quality care.  The Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services requested development of this questionnaire to complement the Long-Stay Resident Instrument, especially for those residents who may be too impaired to respond for themselves.  The number of "Yes" and "No" responses on the "Meeting Basic Needs: Help with Eating, Drinking and Toileting" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All respondents (defined as family members of nursing home residents) who answered the "Meeting Basic Needs: Help with Eating, Drinking and Toileting" questions on the CAHPS Nursing Home Family Member Survey
NQMC-8610	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult inpatients who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") they were provided specific discharge information.   The "Discharge Information" composite measure is based on two questions on the CAHPS Hospital Survey that ask patients:        During this hospital stay, did doctors, nurses or other hospital staff talk with you about whether you would have the help you needed when you left the hospital?       During this hospital stay, did you get information in writing about what symptoms or health problems to look out for after you left the hospital?

NQMC-7252	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the global rating of satisfaction question 2 on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Caregiver Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on caregivers' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following question:         In general, how satisfied are you with the way you were treated by the doctors and nurses looking after your relative during the past month?     Note: Please note that there is another version of the surveyCANHELP Liteavailable from the CARENET Web site.Initiatives to improve satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care remain hampered by a nascent understanding of what quality care means to patients and their families, and how it is best measured. Several experts and professional societies have attempted to define the specific components and related areas (domains) involved in quality EOL care; in contrast, patient and family perspectives are surprisingly lacking.   Most previous studies of quality have focused on outpatients and people with cancer. Researchers recently documented that most Canadians (greater than 70%) die in hospitals, and the majority of decedents are elderly patients who died from causes unrelated to cancer. The trajectory of a patient dying from cancer differs from one dying from other, chronic, end-stage medical conditions. Thus, issues deemed important to quality EOL care that were identified by previous investigators may not be generalizable to seriously ill patients with advanced disease other than cancer, who have a more uncertain prognosis.   Although a "quality death" is an espoused right of Canadians, for many dying patients and their families it is not achieved. Recent reviews and observational studies describe considerable dissatisfaction with EOL care, indicating that there are still opportunities for improvement. Ideally, initiatives aimed at improving EOL care would be informed by the experiences and expectations of patients and their family members. However, such efforts are often hampered by inadequate definitions of quality of care and by suboptimal tools for measurement.   In a recent review, few studies evaluated satisfaction with care at the EOL, and most used non-validated assessment tools. To advance this field, standardized, validated satisfaction questionnaires are needed to measure meaningful outcomes in order to evaluate the effects of various clinical, organizational, policy, and financial initiatives that influence how EOL care is delivered and experienced. By first understanding patients' and families' levels of satisfaction with key elements of EOL care, we will be in a better position to improve their individual care, and to introduce quality improvement initiatives to the health care system as needed.   The Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire was designed to help researchers, health care providers, patients, and their families better understand satisfaction with care provided to seriously ill patients with advanced disease and to identify opportunities for improvement. Caregivers' ratings on the global rating of satisfaction question 2 on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Caregiver Questionnaire (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Caregivers who completed the global rating of satisfaction question 2 on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Caregiver Questionnaire
NQMC-7471	This measure is used to assess the percentage of parents/guardians (respondents) who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their child's providers communicated well.   This "How Well Providers Communicate with Patients" composite measure is based on six questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child 12-Month Survey that asks how often:        Provider explained things in a way that was easy to understand       Provider listened carefully to respondent       Provider gave easy to understand information about health questions or concerns       Provider knew important information about child's medical history       Provider showed respect for what respondent had to say       Provider spent enough time with child     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The 12-month version of the CG-CAHPS asks patients to report on their experiences with a provider's officeboth the health care provider they see and the office staffover the last 12 months. This reference period of 12 months prompts respondents to consider multiple experiences with care when answering the questions. It is also consistent with the 12-month reference period for the commercial version of the Health Plan Survey. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" responses on the "How Well Providers Communicate with Patients" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All parents/guardians who answered the "How Well Providers Communicate with Patients" questions on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child 12-Month Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-3180	This measure assesses the mean score for the questions in the "Discharge" section of the Inpatient Survey.    The "Discharge" section is one of ten sections that comprise the Inpatient Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).      Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction           Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)                The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Discharge" section of the Inpatient Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Inpatient Survey: Calculation of Discharge Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details.

NQMC-7491	This individual items measure is used to assess the percentage of parents/guardians who reported how often they were able to get appointments and needed care for their child.   This "Access to Care" measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child 12-Month Survey with Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Items:        In the last 12 months, how many days did you usually have to wait for an appointment when your child needed care right away? ("Same day," "1 day," "2 to 3 days," "4 to 7 days," "More than 7 days")       In the last 12 months, how often were you able to get the care your child needed from this provider's office during evenings, weekends, or holidays? ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always")     This survey combines the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey with the PCMH Item Set to address the domainsof the medical home.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     To address interest in assessing patient experience with the patient-centered medical home model, the CAHPS Consortium has developed an extended version of the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey that incorporates the CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Item Set. The item set expands on existing CG-CAHPS survey domains and adds questions in other domains to address key elements of the medical home model.  The PCMH is a model for delivering primary care that is patient-centered, comprehensive, coordinated, accessible, and continuously improved through a systems-based approach to quality and safety.  Primary care practices throughout the U.S. are implementing the medical home model. To evaluate the impact of implementing this model, health care organizations and public agencies are investigating how it affects the effectiveness, efficiency, and patient-centeredness of care. The number of "Same day," "1 day," "2 to 3 days," "4 to 7 days," "More than 7 days" responses on the following "Access to Care" question:        In the last 12 months, how many days did you usually have to wait for an appointment when your child needed care right away?

NQMC-2966	This measure is used to assess the proportion of children whose parents indicated  that they routinely received all aspects of family-centered care (FCC).  Topics specifically focus on the following components of FCC:      whether the health care provider understands specific needs of child and concerns of parent,     builds confidence in the parent,     explains things in a way that the parent can understand, and  shows respect for a family's values, customs, and how they prefer to raise their child.      Family-centered care (FCC) is an integral part of the preventive and developmental services recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), as well as an element of medical home.  This measure, as part of the Promoting Health Development Survey (PHDS), captures parent-reported information about the communication and partnership between the provider and the parent that compose FCC which could not otherwise be obtained through medical records or administrative data.  Few quality measures have been available that provide specific information about preventive health care for young children, especially on aspects of care for which parents and families are a reliable source of information about the quality of their child's health care.  The PHDS provides direct feedback from parents about the delivery and quality of preventive services for their children.  The PHDS was developed for the purpose of assisting providers, consumers, purchasers, and policymakers in assessing the degree to which health plans and practitioners provide developmental services as recommended in guidelines set forth by the AAP and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Bright Futures initiative.   Children whose parent responded, "Usually" OR "Always" to all of the items in the "Family-centered Care (FCC)" scale (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Children age 3 months to 48 months who received a well-child visit in the last 12 months and whose parent answered at least half of the items in the "Family-centered Care (FCC)" scale on the Promoting Healthy Development Survey (PHDS)
NQMC-2039	This measure is used to assess HIV positive adolescent and adult patients' ratings of the quality of care at their clinic in comparison to other clinics they know about.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Core Measures.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction    Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall. The number of patients who indicated "Much Better," "Better," "The Same," "Worse," "Much Worse," or "Not Sure" to the item, "I would rate the quality of care at this clinic in comparison to other clinics I know about as..." HIV positive adolescents and adults 13 years of age and older who had at least 2 HIV primary care visits in the last 12 months and completed the survey
NQMC-8957	This measure is used to assess the patients' overall rating of trust in their provider. The survey asked patients to rate their provider on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means that the patient does not trust this provider at all and 10 means that the patient trusts this provider completely.  The Cultural Competence Item Set consists of supplemental items designed for use with the CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Cultural Competence Item Set was developed to improve the ability of the CG-CAHPS to assess the cultural competence of providers; the item set expands on existing survey domains and adds questions in other domains of cultural competency that were not adequately addressed in the existing surveys.  This item set is intended to generate data that health care providers can use to improve their cultural competence by:        Identifying specific topic areas for quality improvement.       Recognizing particular behaviors that inhibit effective communication.       Measuring the effect of behaviors that promote effective communication.     The evidence of significant racial and ethnic disparities in access to health care, outcomes, and health status among racial and ethnic minorities is well documented. Among the strategies that have been advocated for reducing racial and ethnic differences in patient experiences with care is the provision of "culturally competent" medical care. Culturally competent care is defined as care that is responsive to diversity in the patient population and cultural factors that can affect health and health care, such as language, communication styles, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. To be culturally competent, health care providers have to employ various interpersonal and organizational strategies that bridge barriers to communication and understanding that stem from racial, ethnic, cultural, and linguistic differences. Patients' overall rating of trust in their provider on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means that the patient does not trust this provider at all and 10 means that the patient trusts this provider completely (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "Patients' Rating of Trust in Provider" question from the Cultural Competence Item Set on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-6441	This measure is used to assess the percentage of surgical patients who indicated whether ("Yes" or "No") their surgeon was attentive on the day of surgery.  The "Surgeon's Attentiveness on Day of Surgery" composite measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey that asks patients whether their surgeon:        Visited them before surgery       Discussed the outcome of their surgery     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Surgical Care Survey addresses the need to assess and improve the experiences of surgical patients. Like other CAHPS surveys, this questionnaire focuses on aspects of surgical quality that are important to patients and for which patients are the best source of information. The survey results are expected to be useful to everyone with a need for information on the quality of surgeons and surgical care, including patients, practice groups, health plans, insurers, and specialty boards.  The Surgical Care Survey expands on the current CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey, which focuses on primary and specialty care, by incorporating domains that are relevant to surgical care, such as informed consent, anesthesia care, and post-operative follow-up. The survey is unique among CAHPS surveys in that it assesses patients' experiences with surgical care in both the inpatient and outpatient settings by asking respondents about their care before, during, and after surgery.  The number of respondents from the denominator who indicated "Yes" or "No" responses on the "Surgeon's Attentiveness on Day of Surgery" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients age 18 years and older who had a surgery performed during the reporting period and who answered the "Surgeon's Attentiveness on Day of Surgery" questions on the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

NQMC-9082	The CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Child Version provides information on parents' or guardians' experiences with their child's health plan. Results summarize member experiences through ratings, composites and individual question summary rates.  Four global rating questions reflect overall satisfaction.        Rating of All Health Care       Rating of Personal Doctor       Rating of Specialist Seen Most Often       Rating of Health Plan     For this "Rating of Specialist Seen Most Often" measure, parents or guardians rate their child's specialist on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the "worst specialist possible" and 10 is the "best specialist possible".The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. Survey results give health plans the opportunity for continuous improvement in member care. Parents' or guardians' ratings of their child's specialist on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the "worst specialist possible" and 10 is the "best specialist possible" (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Eligible health plan members 17 years and younger whose parent or guardian answered the "Rating of Specialist Seen Most Often" question on the CAHPS 5.0H Child Questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-8623	The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Adult Version provides information on patients' experience with practices and gives a general indication of how well a practice meets patient expectations. Results summarize patient experience with care through an overall rating question, composites and question summary rates.   For this measure, adult patients reported whether ("Yes" or "No") their provider's office gave them information about what do if they needed care during evenings, weekends, or holidays. This measure is based on the following one question in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Adult Version:        Q10: Did this provider's office give you information about what to do if you needed care during evenings, weekends, or holidays?   The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. The number of "Yes" and "No" responses on the question, "Did this provider's office give you information about what to do if you needed care during evenings, weekends, or holidays?"

NQMC-265	This measure assesses the mean score for the questions in the "Family or Friends" section of the Emergency Department Survey.    The "Family or Friends" section is one of eight sections that comprise the Emergency Department Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Healthcare employee satisfaction and retention           Healthcare facility competitive market strength           Hospital profitability           Risk management (likelihood of being sued)                The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Family or Friends" section of the Emergency Department Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Emergency Department Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details. Patients with an emergency department (ED) visit during the reporting period who answered at least one question in the "Family or Friends" section of the Emergency Department Survey. Deceased patients, patients admitted to hospital through the ED, patients who leave the ED against medical advice, patients who leave the ED without being seen, and patients transferred to another hospital/institution are not eligible.
NQMC-5234	This measure is used to assess how easy it was for adult dental plan patients to find a dentist. Patients rate ease of finding a dentist on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is extremely difficult and 10 is extremely easy.   Note: Typically, the percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.Patient satisfaction is a common subject in the dental literature, and this partly seems to result from the unique nature of dental care.  Patients tend to suffer from a fair amount of anxiety related to dental care - most notably with respect to the pain and discomfort associated (at least subjectively) with many dental procedures. One survey in Kentucky found that 40% of the population reported dental fear, with 17% reporting high dental fear.  In that same study, 52% of the population were of the opinion that "pain" was the main reason that people were afraid of the dentist.    The literature also shows that the level of distress, anxiety, or fear appear to influence patients' evaluations of dentists' behaviors and patients' satisfaction with care.  Level of anxiety has even been shown to influence the kind of communication style preferred by the patient.    Pain itself is an important dimension of the dental patient experience, and it has been shown to influence care-seeking and compliance with treatment, increase feelings of helplessness, and predict patterns of health service utilization; patients' descriptions of pain can influence clinical judgments and treatment decisions (e.g., how much pain relief is offered to the patient).  Patients view pain as a "discrete assessable component" of dental treatment.    Communication has been shown to be a significant influence on patient satisfaction.  Several studies emphasize the importance of dentist-patient interaction during the dental encounter - especially in terms of what has been labeled "communicative involvement" in one study.  Communicatively involved dentists appear attentive, perceptive, and responsive to patients' comments and needs; they establish rapport, discuss treatment plans and options, and help elaborate and confirm the patient's understanding of their treatment encounter.   This kind of open, interactive communication has been shown to improve the patient's overall satisfaction with their dental provider.    In addition, it has been generally shown that a dentist's "chairside manner" significantly influences dental care outcomes such as patients' satisfaction, anxiety, and willingness to return for further treatment.  Patients who receive incomplete, general, or impersonal information regarding their condition of treatment tend to perceive their dentist as hostile.  This desire for information reflects the desire patients have to play a collaborative role in decision-making regarding their dental care, although many perceive that they play a passive role in treatment decisions.  In some cases, however, some patients (e.g., those who suffer from particularly high anxiety) do show a preference for interaction marked by "communicative dominance" on the practitioner's part, which refers to the extent to which the dentist controls the nature and topics of the encounter.    Another dimension is satisfaction with the results of dental treatment.  This dimension is to some extent concentrated in the specialty area of prosthodontics - the sub-field that deals with the restoration and replacement of teeth (e.g., fitting of dentures, implants, and bridges) - although these satisfaction concerns do span other areas of dentistry.  This dimension includes basic (improvement in) comfort experienced by the patient as a result of dental work, the functionality of prosthodontic dental work (e.g., in eating or chewing, or phonetics), as well as the overall appearance, or aesthetics, of prosthodontics.   Patients' ratings of how easy it was to find a dentist on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is extremely difficult and 10 is extremely easy.  Note: Higher ratings indicate better quality. Dental plan patients age 18 years and older who answered the "Overall Ratings - Finding a Dentist" question on the CAHPS Dental Plan Survey

NQMC-841	This composite measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who indicated how often ("Always," "Usually," "Sometimes," or "Never") their clinicians communicated well with them. The "How Well Clinicians Communicate" composite measure is based on six questions on the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey.    Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.  Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.  The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies. This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:        To satisfy external standards.       To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.       To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.       To hold providers accountable through public reporting.

NQMC-6911	This measure assesses the mean score for the two questions in the "Moving Through Your Visit" section of the Medical Practice Survey.  The "Moving Through Your Visit" section is one of six sections that comprise the Medical Practice Survey. Each patient has a score for every question that was answered. For each patient, a section score is calculated as the mean of all the question scores in that particular section. Similarly, for each patient, an overall score is calculated as the mean of that patient's section scores.Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care and a component of quality care.   In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century).

It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).  Patient satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: clinical quality (e.g., hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); chronic disease control; compliance; drug complications; quality of life; emotional health status; mental health; physical functioning; physical health status; post-surgery complications; post-surgery recovery times; risk-adjusted mortality rates; unexpected mortality; and work effectiveness (Clark, Drain,  Malone, 2004).  In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction has been linked to the following:         Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; volume; physician satisfaction; patient's trust in provider; retention; employee satisfaction.       Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in expenses; reductionin length of stay; reduction in complaints; reduction in malpractice claims; direct measures of financial performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain,  Malone, 2004).    The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Moving Through Your Visit" section of the Medical Practice Survey  Patients who go for a scheduled or unscheduled doctor visit   Alternatively, visits may be with a non-physician provider such as a physician assistant (PA) or a nurse practitioner (NP). Typically, the patient has an established relationship with their care provider.  See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.
NQMC-7400	This measure is used to assess respondents' overall rating of their family member's care. The survey asked respondents (defined as family members of nursing home residents) to rate the care received at the nursing home on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst care possible and 10 is the best care possible.   The Family Member Survey asks respondents to report on their own experiences (not the resident's) with the nursing home and their perceptions of the quality of care provided to a family member living in a nursing home. This instrument is designed to be administered by mail.The CAHPS Nursing Home Surveys include three instruments designed to provide information on the experiences of nursing home residents and their family members. Multiple versions of the Nursing Home Surveys are available to meet different needs:        Long-Stay Resident Survey       Discharged Resident       Family Member Survey     The Nursing Home Surveys can be used in monitoring programs designed to improve both care quality and patient satisfaction.  Although the family members do not receive care from the nursing home, their experiences at the nursing home and with staff are important in describing the quality of the nursing home. Family members often help choose the nursing home and continue to be involved with their family member after entry, participating in care planning and making decisions on behalf of the resident. Like the CAHPS Nursing Home Resident Surveys, the family reported experiences of care complement other, publicly reported data such as health deficiencies, staffing, and other quality indicators (e.g., percent of residents with restraints), and thus contribute to providing a comprehensive view of quality care.  The Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services requested development of this questionnaire to complement the Long-Stay Resident Instrument especially for those residents who may be too impaired to respond for themselves. Respondent's ratings of the care received at the nursing home on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst care possible and 10 is the best care possible (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All respondents (defined as family members of nursing home residents) who answered the "Rating of Care" question on the CAHPS Nursing Home Family Member Survey
NQMC-8556	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult home health care patients who reported their experiences with their home health care provider's patient care.  The "Care of Patients" composite measure is based on four questions in the Home Health Care CAHPS Survey. Three of the questions ask patients how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always"):        In the last 2 months of care, how often did home health providers from this agency seem informed and up-to-date about all the care or treatment you got at home?       In the last 2 months of care, how often did home health providers from this agency treat you as gently as possible?       In the last 2 months of care, how often did home health providers from this agency treat you with courtesy and respect?     AND  One question asks patients whether ("Yes" or "No"):        In the last 2 months of care, did you have any problems with the care you got through this agency?     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Home Health Care Survey (HHCAHPS) is designed to measure the experiences of people receiving home health care from Medicare-certified home health care agencies. The HHCAHPS Survey will be conducted for home health agencies by approved HHCAHPS vendors.   The survey is designed to meet the following three broad goals:        To produce comparable data on the patient's perspective that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between home health agencies on domains that are important to consumers.       Public reporting of survey results will create incentives for agencies to improve their quality of care.       Public reporting will enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of care provided in return for public investment.

NQMC-9079	The CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Child Version provides information on parents' or guardians' experiences with their child's health plan. Results summarize member experiences through ratings, composites and individual question summary rates.  Four global rating questions reflect overall satisfaction.        Rating of All Health Care       Rating of Personal Doctor       Rating of Specialist Seen Most Often       Rating of Health Plan     For this "Rating of All Health Care" measure, parents or guardians rate their child's health care on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the "worst health care possible" and 10 is the "best health care possible".The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. Survey results give health plans the opportunity for continuous improvement in member care. Parents' or guardians' ratings of all health care their child received on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the "worst health care possible" and 10 is the "best health care possible" (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Eligible health plan members 17 years and younger whose parent or guardian answered the "Rating of All Health Care" question on the CAHPS 5.0H Child Questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-4537	This measure is used to assess adult enrollees' perceptions of their personal doctor. Enrollees rate their personal doctor on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst personal doctor possible and 10 is the best personal doctor possible. Responses are grouped by rating: percentages are reported for ratings of 9 and 10, 7 and 8, and 6 and lower.    Note: The percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 (or sometimes 8, 9, and 10) is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care. The CAHPS consortium began by developing the CAHPS Health Plan Survey, an integrated set of carefully tested and standardized questionnaires and report formats that can be used to produce meaningful, reliable, and comparable information about the experiences of consumers enrolled in health plans.    The CAHPS Health Plan Survey is designed to generate information that consumers can use to choose health plans, that purchasers can use to assess the value of services they buy, and that health plans can use to assess their performance and improve their products and services. As AHRQ had intended, the survey can be used with all types of health insurance consumers--including Medicaid recipients, Medicare beneficiaries, and those who are commercially insured--and across the full range of health care delivery systems, from fee-for-service to managed care plans. The instruments also capture information about special groups, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities and families with children.    The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires health plans to submit measures from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey as part of their HEDIS submission and for accreditation purposes.

NQMC-4548	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who indicated how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") it was easy to get prescription medicines for their children with chronic conditions* through their health plan.    The "Parents' Experience with Prescription Medicines" measure is based on one question in the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 4.0 (Child Questionnaire).    *Children with special health care needs are those who have a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that generally required by children.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care.

The instruments also capture information about special groups, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities and families with children.  The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires health plans to submit measures from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey as part of their HEDIS submission and for accreditation purposes.  Research indicates that children with chronic conditions account for 15 to 18 percent of all children under 18, although some sponsors of the CAHPS Health Plan Survey may serve a relatively higher proportion of children with chronic conditions than is found in the general population.  While the numbers of children with chronic conditions may be small, several factors point to the need to measure and report on quality of care for this segment of the population:        Financial impact. Children with chronic conditions consume a preponderance of the health care dollars spent on children, with estimates ranging from 80 to 90 percent.       Evidence of poor quality. Researchers have found that quality of care for children with chronic conditions is often inadequate. According to studies conducted by FACCT-The Foundation for Accountability, parents of children with chronic conditions rate their experiences with care at a level that ranges from 50 percent to 80 percent of what would be considered optimal.      It is critical to assess and track quality of care for this vulnerable segment so that parents, health plans, and other survey sponsors can evaluate how well the needs of children with chronic conditions are being met and identify which aspects of care need to be improved.            Equity. The experiences that children with chronic conditions have with health plans and providers are often different from those of healthy children, who primarily rely on the health care system for preventive and acute care. Families, health plans, and policymakers need to know if quality of care is not consistent for all children and which plans are best suited to meet the needs of children with chronic conditions.       The need for relevant information. The continual needs of children with chronic conditions far exceed those of their peers, particularly with respect to the type, scope, and frequency of health care services they require. They also have a greater demand for health information, education, partnership with providers, and coordination of care. When reviewing their coverage options, the parents of these children need access to comparative performance information that is relevant to their circumstances.

Results summarize patient experience with care through an overall rating question, composites and question summary rates.   For this "Access" measure, adult patients reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") it was easy for them to get needed care. The "Access" composite measure is based on five questions in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Adult Version:         Q6: In the last 12 months, when you phoned this provider's office to get an appointment for care you needed right away, how often did you get an appointment as soon as you needed?       Q9: In the last 12 months, when you made an appointment for a check-up or routine care with this provider, how often did you get an appointment as soon as you needed?       Q14: In the last 12 months, when you phoned this provider's office during regular office hours, how often did you get an answer to your medical question that same day?       Q16: In the last 12 months, when you phoned this provider's office after regular office hours, how often did you get an answer to your medical question as soon as you needed?       Q18: Wait time includes time spent in the waiting room and exam room. In the last 12 months, how often did you see this provider within 15 minutes of your appointment time?   The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome.

NQMC-2110	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive women who reported how often their women's health care providers and their HIV medical providers worked together to help them.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Women's Health Care Module.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction     Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall.

NQMC-7259	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the global rating of satisfaction question 1 on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Bereavement Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on caregivers' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following question:        In general, how satisfied are you with the quality of care your relative received in the last month of life?     Note: Please note that there is another version of the surveyCANHELP Liteavailable from the CARENET Web site.Initiatives to improve satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care remain hampered by a nascent understanding of what quality care means to patients and their families, and how it is best measured. Several experts and professional societies have attempted to define the specific components and related areas (domains) involved in quality EOL care; in contrast, patient and family perspectives are surprisingly lacking.   Most previous studies of quality have focused on outpatients and people with cancer. Researchers recently documented that most Canadians (greater than 70%) die in hospitals, and the majority of decedents are elderly patients who died from causes unrelated to cancer. The trajectory of a patient dying from cancer differs from one dying from other, chronic, end-stage medical conditions. Thus, issues deemed important to quality EOL care that were identified by previous investigators may not be generalizable to seriously ill patients with advanced disease other than cancer, who have a more uncertain prognosis.   Although a "quality death" is an espoused right of Canadians, for many dying patients and their families it is not achieved. Recent reviews and observational studies describe considerable dissatisfaction with EOL care, indicating that there are still opportunities for improvement. Ideally, initiatives aimed at improving EOL care would be informed by the experiences and expectations of patients and their family members. However, such efforts are often hampered by inadequate definitions of quality of care and by suboptimal tools for measurement.   In a recent review, few studies evaluated satisfaction with care at the EOL, and most used non-validated assessment tools. To advance this field, standardized, validated satisfaction questionnaires are needed to measure meaningful outcomes in order to evaluate the effects of various clinical, organizational, policy, and financial initiatives that influence how EOL care is delivered and experienced. By first understanding patients' and families' levels of satisfaction with key elements of EOL care, we will be in a better position to improve their individual care, and to introduce quality improvement initiatives to the health care system as needed.   The Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire was designed to help researchers, health care providers, patients, and their families better understand satisfaction with care provided to seriously ill patients with advanced disease and to identify opportunities for improvement.

NQMC-7493	This individual items measure is used to assess the percentage of parents/guardians who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") their child's provider gave them information about care and other appointments.   This "Information about Care and Appointments" measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child 12-Month Survey with Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Items:        Did this provider's office give you information about what to do if your child needed care during evenings, weekends, or holidays?       Some offices remind patients between visits about tests, treatment or appointments. In the last 12 months, did you get any reminders about your child's care from this provider's office between visits?     This survey combines the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey with the PCMH Item Set to address the domains of the medical home.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     To address interest in assessing patient experience with the patient-centered medical home model, the CAHPS Consortium has developed an extended version of the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey that incorporates the CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Item Set. The item set expands on existing CG-CAHPS survey domains and adds questions in other domains to address key elements of the medical home model.  The PCMH is a model for delivering primary care that is patient-centered, comprehensive, coordinated, accessible, and continuously improved through a systems-based approach to quality and safety.  Primary care practices throughout the U.S. are implementing the medical home model. To evaluate the impact of implementing this model, health care organizations and public agencies are investigating how it affects the effectiveness, efficiency, and patient-centeredness of care.

NQMC-8641	The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Child Version provides information on parents' experience with their child's practice. Results summarize patient experiences through an overall rating question, composites and individual question summary rates.  For this measure, parents or guardians reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") someone from their child's provider's office followed up with them about their child's blood test, x-ray, or other test results. This measure is based on the following one question in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Child Version:        Q34: In the last 12 months, when this provider ordered a blood test, x-ray, or other test for your child, how often did someone from this provider's office follow up to give you those results?

NQMC-5618	This measure is used to assess the overall satisfaction of family members of patients in the intensive care unit based upon their responses to the Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit (FS-ICU 24) questionnaire. In the intensive care unit (ICU), patient-centered care includes family-centered care. Since most ICU patients cannot make decisions for themselves, families are often involved as surrogate decision makers. Therefore, the perspectives of family and other surrogate decision makers are especially important in the critical care setting, and family satisfaction is an important outcome measure.  Families have an important role in sharing relevant information, for example: what transpired before the admission; what kind of person the patient is; and, perhaps most importantly, what the patient would want in terms of care, given the current situation.   A key domain of quality of care is satisfaction with care. Because desirable health status outcomes may not be attained after critical illness and because mortality rates in tertiary referral ICUs may approach 15% to 20%, satisfaction with care is important not only to patients but also to their families. Furthermore, given that the majority of critically ill patients (especially those at high risk for poor outcomes) are unable to participate in decision making about treatments, the family's perspective is central to understanding (and measuring) satisfaction with care in the ICU.  Respondents' answers to the Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit (FS-ICU 24) questionnaire (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Family members of intensive care unit patients who completed the Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit (FS-ICU 24) questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-2297	This measure is used to assess the mean score for the questions in the "Arranging Hospice Care" section of the Hospice Services Survey.  The "Arranging Hospice Care" section is one of five sections that comprise the Hospice Services Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988, 1744) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).      Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction           Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)                The mean of all the family members' scores for the questions from the "Arranging Hospice Care" section of the Hospice Services Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Hospice Services Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details.

NQMC-7487	This individual items measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients who reported how often they were able to get appointments and needed care.   This "Access to Care" measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult 12-Month Survey with Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Items:        In the last 12 months, how many days did you usually have to wait for an appointment when you needed care right away? ("Same day," "1 day," "2 to 3 days," "4 to 7 days," "More than 7 days")       In the last 12 months, how often were you able to get the care you needed from this provider's office during evenings, weekends, or holidays? ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always")     This survey combines the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey with the PCMH Item Set to address the domains of the medical home.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     To address interest in assessing patient experience with the patient-centered medical home model, the CAHPS Consortium has developed an extended version of the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey that incorporates the CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Item Set. The item set expands on existing CG-CAHPS survey domains and adds questions in other domains to address key elements of the medical home model.  The PCMH is a model for delivering primary care that is patient-centered, comprehensive, coordinated, accessible, and continuously improved through a systems-based approach to quality and safety.  Primary care practices throughout the U.S. are implementing the medical home model. To evaluate the impact of implementing this model, health care organizations and public agencies are investigating how it affects the effectiveness, efficiency, and patient-centeredness of care. The number of "Same day," "1 day," "2 to 3 days," "4 to 7 days," "More than 7 days" responses on the following "Access to Care" question:        In the last 12 months, how many days did you usually have to wait for an appointment when you needed care right away?

NQMC-5235	This measure is used to assess adult dental plan patients' perceptions of their dental plan. Patients rate their dental plan a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst dental plan possible and 10 is the best dental plan possible.  Note: Typically, the percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.Patient satisfaction is a common subject in the dental literature, and this partly seems to result from the unique nature of dental care.  Patients tend to suffer from a fair amount of anxiety related to dental care - most notably with respect to the pain and discomfort associated (at least subjectively) with many dental procedures. One survey in Kentucky found that 40% of the population reported dental fear, with 17% reporting high dental fear.  In that same study, 52% of the population were of the opinion that "pain" was the main reason that people were afraid of the dentist.    The literature also shows that the level of distress, anxiety, or fear appear to influence patients' evaluations of dentists' behaviors and patients' satisfaction with care.  Level of anxiety has even been shown to influence the kind of communication style preferred by the patient.    Pain itself is an important dimension of the dental patient experience, and it has been shown to influence care-seeking and compliance with treatment, increase feelings of helplessness, and predict patterns of health service utilization; patients' descriptions of pain can influence clinical judgments and treatment decisions (e.g., how much pain relief is offered to the patient).  Patients view pain as a "discrete assessable component" of dental treatment.    Communication has been shown to be a significant influence on patient satisfaction.  Several studies emphasize the importance of dentist-patient interaction during the dental encounter - especially in terms of what has been labeled "communicative involvement" in one study.  Communicatively involved dentists appear attentive, perceptive, and responsive to patients' comments and needs; they establish rapport, discuss treatment plans and options, and help elaborate and confirm the patient's understanding of their treatment encounter.   This kind of open, interactive communication has been shown to improve the patient's overall satisfaction with their dental provider.    In addition, it has been generally shown that a dentist's "chairside manner" significantly influences dental care outcomes such as patients' satisfaction, anxiety, and willingness to return for further treatment.  Patients who receive incomplete, general, or impersonal information regarding their condition of treatment tend to perceive their dentist as hostile.  This desire for information reflects the desire patients have to play a collaborative role in decision-making regarding their dental care, although many perceive that they play a passive role in treatment decisions.  In some cases, however, some patients (e.g., those who suffer from particularly high anxiety) do show a preference for interaction marked by "communicative dominance" on the practitioner's part, which refers to the extent to which the dentist controls the nature and topics of the encounter.    Another dimension is satisfaction with the results of dental treatment.  This dimension is to some extent concentrated in the specialty area of prosthodontics - the sub-field that deals with the restoration and replacement of teeth (e.g., fitting of dentures, implants, and bridges) - although these satisfaction concerns do span other areas of dentistry.  This dimension includes basic (improvement in) comfort experienced by the patient as a result of dental work, the functionality of prosthodontic dental work (e.g., in eating or chewing, or phonetics), as well as the overall appearance, or aesthetics, of prosthodontics.   Patients' ratings of their dental plan on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst dental plan possible and 10 is the best dental plan possible.    Note: Higher ratings indicate better quality.   Dental plan patients age 18 years and older who answered the "Overall Ratings - Dental Plan" question on the CAHPS Dental Plan Survey
NQMC-7258	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the "Your Well Being" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Caregiver Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on the caregivers' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following questions:        How satisfied are you with the level of confidence you felt during the past month in your relative's ability to manage his/her own illness?       How satisfied are you that during the past month you had enough time and energy to take care of yourself?       How satisfied are you that you had family or friends to support you when you felt lonely or isolated during the past month?       How satisfied are you that you were able during the past month to contribute to others in a meaningful way?       How satisfied are you that you and your relative did special things (for example: resolve conflicts, complete projects, participate in special family events, travel) you wanted to do during the past month?       How satisfied are you that you were at peace during the past month?     Note: The "Your Well Being" domain is one of six domains comprising the CANHELP Caregiver Questionnaire. Mean scale scores are calculated for each domain of the questionnaire. In addition, an "Overall" satisfaction score is calculated. Please note that there is another version of the surveyCANHELP Liteavailable from the CARENET Web site.Initiatives to improve satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care remain hampered by a nascent understanding of what quality care means to patients and their families, and how it is best measured. Several experts and professional societies have attempted to define the specific components and related areas (domains) involved in quality EOL care; in contrast, patient and family perspectives are surprisingly lacking.   Most previous studies of quality have focused on outpatients and people with cancer. Researchers recently documented that most Canadians (greater than 70%) die in hospitals, and the majority of decedents are elderly patients who died from causes unrelated to cancer. The trajectory of a patient dying from cancer differs from one dying from other, chronic, end-stage medical conditions. Thus, issues deemed important to quality EOL care that were identified by previous investigators may not be generalizable to seriously ill patients with advanced disease other than cancer, who have a more uncertain prognosis.   Although a "quality death" is an espoused right of Canadians, for many dying patients and their families it is not achieved. Recent reviews and observational studies describe considerable dissatisfaction with EOL care, indicating that there are still opportunities for improvement. Ideally, initiatives aimed at improving EOL care would be informed by the experiences and expectations of patients and their family members. However, such efforts are often hampered by inadequate definitions of quality of care and by suboptimal tools for measurement.   In a recent review, few studies evaluated satisfaction with care at the EOL, and most used non-validated assessment tools. To advance this field, standardized, validated satisfaction questionnaires are needed to measure meaningful outcomes in order to evaluate the effects of various clinical, organizational, policy, and financial initiatives that influence how EOL care is delivered and experienced. By first understanding patients' and families' levels of satisfaction with key elements of EOL care, we will be in a better position to improve their individual care, and to introduce quality improvement initiatives to the health care system as needed.   The Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire was designed to help researchers, health care providers, patients, and their families better understand satisfaction with care provided to seriously ill patients with advanced disease and to identify opportunities for improvement.

NQMC-2243	This measure is used to assess the mean score for the questions in the "Tests and Treatments" section of the Inpatient Pediatric Survey.    The "Tests and Treatments" section is one of ten sections that comprise the Inpatient Pediatric Survey.  Mean section scores are reported for each section of this survey.  In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).      Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction           Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)                The mean of all the parents' scores for the questions from the "Tests and Treatments" section of the Inpatient Pediatric Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Inpatient Pediatric Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details.

NQMC-7486	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients who reported how often their provider discussed medication decisions.   This "Providers Discuss Medication Decisions (Adult Only)" composite measure is based on three questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult 12-Month Survey with Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Items. Two questions ask how often ("Not at all," "A little," "Some," or "A lot"):        When you talked about starting or stopping a prescription medicine, how much did this provider talk about the reasons you might want to take a medicine?       When you talked about starting or stopping a prescription medicine, how much did this provider talk about the reasons you might not want to take a medicine?     AND  One question asks patients whether ("Yes" or "No"):        When you talked about starting or stopping a prescription medicine, did this provider ask you what you thought was best for you?     This survey combines the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey with the PCMH Item Set to address the domains of the medical home.

NQMC-6914	This measure assesses the mean score for the two questions in the "Overall Assessment" section of the Medical Practice Survey.  The "Overall Assessment" section is one of six sections that comprise the Medical Practice Survey. Each patient has a score for every question that was answered. For each patient, a section score is calculated as the mean of all the question scores in that particular section. Similarly, for each patient, an overall score is calculated as the mean of that patient's section scores.Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care and a component of quality care.

The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).

In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction has been linked to the following:         Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; volume; physician satisfaction; patient's trust in provider; retention; employee satisfaction.       Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in expenses; reduction in length of stay; reduction in complaints; reduction in malpractice claims; direct measures of financial performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain,  Malone, 2004).

NQMC-7262	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the "Characteristics of the Doctors and Nurses" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Bereavement Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on the caregivers' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following questions:        How satisfied are you with the level of trust and confidence you had in the nurses who looked after your relative in the last month of life?       How satisfied are you that the doctors and nurses who looked after your relative in the last month of life knew enough about his or her health problems to give the best possible care?       How satisfied are you that the doctors and nurses looking after your relative in the last month of life were compassionate and supportive of him or her?       How satisfied are you that the doctors and nurses looking after your relative in the last month of life were compassionate and supportive of you?       How satisfied are you that the doctors and nurses who treated your relative in the last month of life preserved his or her sense of dignity?     Note: The "Characteristics of the Doctors and Nurses" domain is one of six domains comprising the CANHELP Bereavement Questionnaire. Mean scale scores are calculated for each domain of the questionnaire. In addition, an "Overall" satisfaction score is calculated. Please note that there is another version of the surveyCANHELP Liteavailable from the CARENET Web site.Initiatives to improve satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care remain hampered by a nascent understanding of what quality care means to patients and their families, and how it is best measured. Several experts and professional societies have attempted to define the specific components and related areas (domains) involved in quality EOL care; in contrast, patient and family perspectives are surprisingly lacking.   Most previous studies of quality have focused on outpatients and people with cancer. Researchers recently documented that most Canadians (greater than 70%) die in hospitals, and the majority of decedents are elderly patients who died from causes unrelated to cancer. The trajectory of a patient dying from cancer differs from one dying from other, chronic, end-stage medical conditions. Thus, issues deemed important to quality EOL care that were identified by previous investigators may not be generalizable to seriously ill patients with advanced disease other than cancer, who have a more uncertain prognosis.   Although a "quality death" is an espoused right of Canadians, for many dying patients and their families it is not achieved. Recent reviews and observational studies describe considerable dissatisfaction with EOL care, indicating that there are still opportunities for improvement. Ideally, initiatives aimed at improving EOL care would be informed by the experiences and expectations of patients and their family members. However, such efforts are often hampered by inadequate definitions of quality of care and by suboptimal tools for measurement.   In a recent review, few studies evaluated satisfaction with care at the EOL, and most used non-validated assessment tools. To advance this field, standardized, validated satisfaction questionnaires are needed to measure meaningful outcomes in order to evaluate the effects of various clinical, organizational, policy, and financial initiatives that influence how EOL care is delivered and experienced. By first understanding patients' and families' levels of satisfaction with key elements of EOL care, we will be in a better position to improve their individual care, and to introduce quality improvement initiatives to the health care system as needed.

NQMC-7257	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the "Your Involvement" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Caregiver Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on the caregivers' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following questions:        How satisfied are you with the level of confidence you felt during the past month in your ability to help your relative manage his/her illness?       How satisfied are you with discussions during the past month with the doctor(s) about the use of life sustaining technologies (for example: CPR or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, breathing machines, dialysis)?       How satisfied are you that, during the past month, you have come to understand what to expect at the end stage of your relative's illness (for example: in terms of symptoms and comfort measures)?       How satisfied are you with your role during the past month in decision-making regarding your relative's medical care?       How satisfied are you with discussions with your relative during the past month about wishes for future care in the event he or she is unable to make those decisions?       How satisfied are you that you were able during the past month to talk comfortably with your relative about his/her illness, dying, and death?       How satisfied are you that your relationship with your relative was strengthened during the past month?     Note: The "Your Involvement" domain is one of six domains comprising the CANHELP Caregiver Questionnaire. Mean scale scores are calculated for each domain of the questionnaire.

NQMC-8606	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult inpatients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always")their nurses communicated well.  The "Communication with Nurses" composite measure is based on three questions on the CAHPS Hospital Survey that ask patients:        During this hospital stay, how often did nurses treat you with courtesy and respect?       During this hospital stay, how often did nurses listen carefully to you?       During this hospital stay, how often did nurses explain things in a way you could understand?     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey is part of a larger Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) program sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). CAHPS was initiated by AHRQ in 1995 to establish survey and reporting products that provide consumers with information on health plan and provider performance. Since 1995, the initiative has grown to include a range of health care services at multiple levels of the delivery system. HCAHPS was developed by AHRQ in response to the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services' (CMS) request for a survey that supports the assessment of patients' perspectives on hospital care.   The purpose of HCAHPS is to uniformly measure and publicly report patients' perspectives on their inpatient care. While many hospitals collected information on patients' satisfaction with care, there was no national standard for collecting this information that would yield valid comparisons across all hospitals. HCAHPS represents the first national standard for the collection of information on patients' perspectives about their inpatient care.  Three broad goals have shaped the HCAHPS survey. First, the survey is designed to produce comparable data on patients' perspectives of care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between hospitals on domains that are important to consumers. Second, public reporting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care. Third, public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of hospital care provided in return for the public investment. With these goals in mind, the HCAHPS project has taken substantial steps to assure that the survey is credible, useful, and practical. This methodology and the information it generates is made available to the public. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always" responses on the "Communication with Nurses" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Hospital inpatients with an admission during the reporting period who answered the "Communication with Nurses" questions on the CAHPS Hospital Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-847	This single-item measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who reported how often ("Always," "Usually," "Sometimes," or "Never") they were seen within 15 minutes of their appointment.    Note: For consumer-level reporting, results may be reported as the percentage of the "Always" plus "Usually" responses or the percentage of the "Always" responses.  Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all response choices (i.e., "Always," "Usually," "Sometimes," or "Never") are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.  The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies. This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:        To satisfy external standards.       To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.       To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.       To hold providers accountable through public reporting.    The number of health plan members from the denominator who indicated "Always," "Usually," "Sometimes," or "Never" regarding how often they were seen within 15 minutes of their appointment Health plan members age 18 years and older, enrolled in a managed care organization (MCO) or managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) for the previous 12 months with no more than one break in enrollment of up to 45 days during the enrollment period, who received behavioral health care services and who answered the "Having to Wait in the Office" question on the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey

NQMC-6478	This measure is used to assess the parent's report of timely and convenient access to care for his or her child, based on the parent's responses ("0 = never," "1 = sometimes," "2 = often," "3 = almost always," "4 = always") to the "Access" items in the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument:        Is it easy for you to travel to the doctor?       Can you see the doctor as soon as you want for routine care (check ups, physicals) for your child?       If your child is sick, can you see the doctor within one day?       Can you get help or advice on evenings or weekends?   High quality pediatric primary care is a cornerstone of efforts to improve health outcomes, control health care spending, and improve access to care. To improve the quality of pediatric primary care, a reliable and valid measure must exist. The ideal instrument is one that is brief, practical, reliable, and valid. Given the current high rate of uninsured children and children without a regular source of care, such an instrument must also be applicable regardless of insurance status and health plan membership or the presence of a regular provider of care.  The Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure is based on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) definition of primary care, which is similar to the American Academy of Pediatrics concept of a medical home. With the use of this definition as a criterion, the P3C was designed to measure 6 components of care (longitudinal continuity, access, contextual knowledge, communication, comprehensiveness, and coordination) that, when present, constitute high-quality primary care experiences. High scores reflect care conforming to this a priori definition.   The P3C measures perceptions of quality based on parents' reports of their experiences, rather than ratings of satisfaction with those experiences. The P3C was designed to measure parents' perceptions of experiences in receiving primary care, rather than the quality of a particular provider of primary care. This was done so that the care received by children without a regular provider also could be described in relation to the IOM definition of quality primary care. This is important, given the large proportions of uninsured children and children without a regular source of care who receive primary health care at emergency departments or community clinics, where they might not see a consistent provider. The number of responses ("0 = never," "1 = sometimes," "2 = often," "3 = almost always," "4 = always") to the "Access" items in the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Children whose parent or guardian answered the "Access" items on the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument

Patients' ratings on the "Illness Management" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Patient Questionnaire (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of questions answered by patients who completed the "Illness Management" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Patient Questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-2241	This measure is used to assess the mean score for the questions in the "Meals" section of the Inpatient Pediatric Survey.    The "Meals" section is one of ten sections that comprise the Inpatient Pediatric Survey.  Mean section scores are reported for each section of this survey.  In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).      Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction           Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)                The mean of all the parents' scores for the questions from the "Meals" section of the Inpatient Pediatric Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Inpatient Pediatric Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details. Parents of patients with an inpatient pediatric care admission discharged during the reporting period who answered at least one question in the "Meals" section of the Inpatient Pediatric Survey.  All deceased patients and newborns are excluded from sampling.  
NQMC-2096	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adult patients who reported whether they needed more information about the purpose of their psychiatric medications and their side effects.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Mental Health Services Module.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction    Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall. The number of patients who indicated "Strongly Disagree," "Disagree," "Agree," "Strongly Agree," or "Does Not Apply" to the item, "I needed more information about the purpose of my psychiatric medications and their side effects." HIV positive adult patients 18 years of age and older who received one or more mental health services in the last 12 months and completed the survey
NQMC-7551	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score for the "Community Engagement" items on the Communication Climate Assessment Toolkit (C-CAT) Patient (or Pediatric) Survey and Staff Survey.   This composite comprises 3 items on the Patient (or Pediatric) Survey and 2 items on the Staff Survey:   Patient (or Pediatric) Survey         Did hospital (clinic) staff help you find community resources?       Does the hospital (clinic) serve your community well?       Do hospital (clinic) staff come from your community?     Staff Survey         Overall, how would you rate the hospital (clinic)'s level of involvement in the local community?       Overall, how would you rate the hospital (clinic)'s efforts to help patients access community resources (e.g., assistance with medications, nutrition, insurance, legal aid, etc.)?     This measure is one of nine composite measures derived from the C-CAT. Effective communication is the foundation for quality health care. Communication between health care practitioners, patients, and other members of care teams affects patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment recommendations, and patient safety. According to the Joint Commission, miscommunication is the leading cause of sentinel events (serious medical errors). In addition, health and health care disparities are created when miscommunication disproportionately affects certain patient populations. As a result, understanding and improving communication may be a key to addressing disparities, which is an important national health policy goal.  Patient-centered communication is well recognized as a key to quality care, and an organization's climate and infrastructure can affect communication in a number of important ways. We developed a set of assessment tools to measure a hospital or clinic's organizational climate specifically in regard to patient-centered communication. The tools provide a 360 evaluation of organizational communication climate and include patient and staff surveys that can be used to derive standardized domain scores in each of 9 key areas of organizational communication climate.  An organization should make demonstrable, proactive efforts to understand an reach out to the communities it serves, including establishing relationships with community groups and developing opportunities for community members to participate in shaping organizational policies.

NQMC-7484	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") their provider paid attention to their mental and emotional health.  This "Providers Pay Attention to Your Mental and Emotional Health (Adult Only)" composite measure is based on three questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult 12-Month Survey with Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Items:        In the last 12 months, did anyone in this provider's office ask you if there was a period of time when you felt sad, empty or depressed?       In the last 12 months, did you and anyone in this provider's office talk about things in your life that worry you or cause you stress?       In the last 12 months, did you and anyone in this provider's office talk about a personal problem, family problem, alcohol use, drug use, or a mental or emotional illness?     This survey combines the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey with the PCMH Item Set to address the domains of the medical home.  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     To address interest in assessing patient experience with the patient-centered medical home model, the CAHPS Consortium has developed an extended version of the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey that incorporates the CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Item Set. The item set expands on existing CG-CAHPS survey domains and adds questions in other domains to address key elements of the medical home model.  The PCMH is a model for delivering primary care that is patient-centered, comprehensive, coordinated, accessible, and continuously improved through a systems-based approach to quality and safety.  Primary care practices throughout the U.S. are implementing the medical home model. To evaluate the impact of implementing this model, health care organizations and public agencies are investigating how it affects the effectiveness, efficiency, and patient-centeredness of care. The number of "Yes" or "No" responses on the "Providers Pay Attention to Your Mental or Emotional Health (Adult Only)" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "Providers Pay Attention to Your Mental or Emotional Health (Adult Only)" questions on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult 12-Month Survey with Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Items (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-8962	This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") they got a timely appointment through email or a Web site.   This "Getting Timely Appointments Through Email or Web Site" measure is based on one question from the CAHPS Health Information Technology (Health IT) Item Set consisting of supplemental items designed for use with the CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey. The question asks how often:        Patient got an appointment using email or Web site as soon as needed   The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Health Information Technology (Health IT) Item Set is designed for use with the CG-CAHPS to assess a variety of aspects of health IT.  This item set is intended to collect data that health care providers can use to improve care by:        Identifying specific topic areas for quality improvement.       Recognizing particular behaviors or actions that inhibit the effective use of health IT.       Measuring the effect of behaviors that promote the effective use of health IT.     There are many local, regional, and national initiatives to accelerate the adoption of health IT. Because of the associated changes in the delivery of care, assessing the use of health IT from the patient's perspective is important.  While the technology has the potential to improve communication and access for patients, some studies have reported negative outcomes, such as depersonalization of the provider visit. The CAHPS Consortium developed items that would assess aspects of the use of health IT for which patients are the best or only source of information. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" responses on the "Getting Timely Appointments Through Email or a Web Site" question (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "Getting Timely Appointments Through Email or a Web Site" question from the Health Information Technology Item Set on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

NQMC-6480	This measure is used to assess the parent's report of how well the physician listens and explains during their interactions, based on the parent's responses ("0 = never," "1 = sometimes," "2 = often," "3 = almost always," "4 = always") to the "Communication" items in the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument:        Do you feel comfortable asking the doctor questions?       Does the doctor explain things to your satisfaction?       Does the doctor spend enough time with you and your child?       Does the doctor listen to you?   High quality pediatric primary care is a cornerstone of efforts to improve health outcomes, control health care spending, and improve access to care. To improve the quality of pediatric primary care, a reliable and valid measure must exist. The ideal instrument is one that is brief, practical, reliable, and valid. Given the current high rate of uninsured children and children without a regular source of care, such an instrument must also be applicable regardless of insurance status and health plan membership or the presence of a regular provider of care.  The Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure is based on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) definition of primary care, which is similar to the American Academy of Pediatrics concept of a medical home. With the use of this definition as a criterion, the P3C was designed to measure 6 components of care (longitudinal continuity, access, contextual knowledge, communication, comprehensiveness, and coordination) that, when present, constitute high-quality primary care experiences. High scores reflect care conforming to this a priori definition.  The P3C measures perceptions of quality based on parents' reports of their experiences, rather than ratings of satisfaction with those experiences. The P3C was designed to measure parents' perceptions of experiences in receiving primary care, rather than the quality of a particular provider of primary care. This was done so that the care received by children without a regular provider also could be described in relation to the IOM definition of quality primary care. This is important, given the large proportions of uninsured children and children without a regular source of care who receive primary health care at emergency departments or community clinics, where they might not see a consistent provider. The number of responses ("0 = never," "1 = sometimes," "2 = often," "3 = almost always," "4 = always") to the "Communication" items in the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Children whose parent or guardian answered the "Communication" items on the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument
NQMC-7397	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who reported how often their family member's nurses/aides were kind and respectful.   This "Nurses/Aides' Kindness/Respect Towards Resident" composite measure is based on five questions in the CAHPS Nursing Home Family Member Survey that asks respondents (defined as family members of nursing home residents) how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always"):        Nurses/Aides treat resident with courtesy and respect       Nurses/Aides treat resident with kindness       Nurses/Aides really cared about resident       Nurses/Aides appropriate with resident displaying behavioral problems     AND  Two questions ask respondents whether ("Yes" or "No"):        Nurses/Aides rude to resident     The Family Member Survey asks respondents to report on their own experiences (not the resident's) with the nursing home and their perceptions of the quality of care provided to a family member living in a nursing home. This instrument is designed to be administered by mail.   Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level (nursing home) reporting.The CAHPS Nursing Home Surveys include three instruments designed to provide information on the experiences of nursing home residents and their family members. Multiple versions of the Nursing Home Surveys are available to meet different needs:        Long-Stay Resident Survey       Discharged Resident       Family Member Survey     The Nursing Home Surveys can be used in monitoring programs designed to improve both care quality and patient satisfaction.  Although the family members do not receive care from the nursing home, their experiences at the nursing home and with staff are important in describing the quality of the nursing home. Family members often help choose the nursing home and continue to be involved with their family member after entry, participating in care planning and making decisions on behalf of the resident. Like the CAHPS Nursing Home Resident Surveys, the family reported experiences of care complement other, publicly reported data such as health deficiencies, staffing, and other quality indicators (e.g., percent of residents with restraints), and thus contribute to providing a comprehensive view of quality care.  The Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services requested development of this questionnaire to complement the Long-Stay Resident Instrument especially for those residents who may be too impaired to respond for themselves. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" and "Yes" or "No" responses on the "Nurses/Aides' Kindness/Respect Towards Resident" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All respondents (defined as family members of nursing home residents) who answered the "Nurses/Aides' Kindness/Respect Towards Resident" questions on the CAHPS Nursing Home Family Member Survey
NQMC-7485	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") their provider supported them in taking care of their own health.  This "Providers Support You in Taking Care of Your Own Health" composite measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult 12-Month Survey with Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Items:        In the last 12 months, did anyone in this provider's office talk with you about specific goals for your health?       In the last 12 months, did anyone in this provider's office ask you if there are things that make it hard for you to take care of your health?     This survey combines the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey with the PCMH Item Set to address the domains of the medical home.

NQMC-2965	This measure is used to assess the average percentage of recommended of aspects of family-centered care (FCC) regularly received by the parent from the pediatric clinician.  Topics specifically focus on the following components of FCC:      whether the health care provider understands specific needs of child and concerns of parent,     builds confidence in the parent,     explains things in a way that the parent can understand, and  shows respect for a family's values, customs, and how they prefer to raise their child.      Family-centered care (FCC) is an integral part of the preventive and developmental services recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), as well as an element of medical home.  This measure, as part of the Promoting Health Development Survey (PHDS), captures parent-reported information about the communication and partnership between the provider and the parent that compose FCC which could not otherwise be obtained through medical records or administrative data.  Few quality measures have been available that provide specific information about preventive health care for young children, especially on aspects of care for which parents and families are a reliable source of information about the quality of their child's health care.  The PHDS provides direct feedback from parents about the delivery and quality of preventive services for their children.  The PHDS was developed for the purpose of assisting providers, consumers, purchasers, and policymakers in assessing the degree to which health plans and practitioners provide developmental services as recommended in guidelines set forth by the AAP and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Bright Futures initiative.   The number of "Usually" OR "Always" responses to items in the "Family-centered Care (FCC)" scale (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) The number of items on the "Family-centered Care (FCC)" scale the parent answered.  Includes children age 3 months to 48 months who received a well-child visit in the last 12 months and whose parent answered at least half of the items in the "Family-centered Care (FCC)" scale on the Promoting Healthy Development Survey (PHDS).

NQMC-3181	This measure assesses the mean score for the questions in the "Personal Issues" section of the Inpatient Survey.    The "Personal Issues" section is one of ten sections that comprise the Inpatient Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997).

The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).      Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction           Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)                The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Personal Issues" section of the Inpatient Survey Patients with an inpatient admission during the reporting period who answered at least one question in the "Personal Issues" section of the Inpatient Survey.

NQMC-8559	This measure is used to assess adult home health care patients' overall rating of the care they received from their agency's home health providers. This survey asks patients to rate their care on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst home health care possible and 10 is the best home health care possible.The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Home Health Care Survey (HHCAHPS) is designed to measure the experiences of people receiving home health care from Medicare-certified home health care agencies. The HHCAHPS Survey will be conducted for home health agencies by approved HHCAHPS vendors.   The survey is designed to meet the following three broad goals:        To produce comparable data on the patient's perspective that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between home health agencies on domains that are important to consumers.       Public reporting of survey results will create incentives for agencies to improve their quality of care.       Public reporting will enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of care provided in return for public investment.    Patient's overall rating of the care they received from their agency's home health providers on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst home health care possible and 10 is the best home health care possible (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Home health care patients age 18 years and older who answered the "Overall Rating of Care" question on the Home Health Care CAHPS Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-6445	This measure is used to assess surgical patients' overall rating of the care received from their surgeon. The survey asked patients to rate their surgeon on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst surgeon possible and 10 is the best surgeon possible.The CAHPS Surgical Care Survey addresses the need to assess and improve the experiences of surgical patients. Like other CAHPS surveys, this questionnaire focuses on aspects of surgical quality that are important to patients and for which patients are the best source of information. The survey results are expected to be useful to everyone with a need for information on the quality of surgeons and surgical care, including patients, practice groups, health plans, insurers, and specialty boards.  The Surgical Care Survey expands on the current CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey, which focuses on primary and specialty care, by incorporating domains that are relevant to surgical care, such as informed consent, anesthesia care, and post-operative follow-up. The survey is unique among CAHPS surveys in that it assesses patients' experiences with surgical care in both the inpatient and outpatient settings by asking respondents about their care before, during, and after surgery.  Patient's ratings of their surgeon on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst surgeon possible and 10 is the best surgeon possible Patients age 18 years and older who had a surgery performed during the reporting period and who answered the "Patients' Rating of the Surgeon" question on the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-8629	The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Child Version provides information on parents' experience with their child's practice. Results summarize patient experiences through an overall rating question, composites and individual question summary rates.  For this "Access" measure, parents or guardians reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") it was easy for their child to get needed care. The "Access" composite measure is based on five questions in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Child Version:         Q13: In the last 12 months, when you phoned this provider's office to get an appointment for care your child needed right away, how often did you get an appointment as soon as your child needed?       Q16: In the last 12 months, when you made an appointment for a check-up or routine care for your child with this provider, how often did you get an appointment as soon as your child needed?       Q21: In the last 12 months, when you phoned this provider's office during regular office hours, how often did you get an answer to your medical question that same day?       Q23: In the last 12 months, when you phoned this provider's office after regular office hours, how often did you get an answer to your medical question as soon as you needed?       Q25: Wait time includes time spent in the waiting room and exam room. In the last 12 months, how often did your child see this provider within 15 minutes of his or her appointment time?   The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome.

NQMC-7256	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the "Communication and Decision Making" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Caregiver Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on the caregivers' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following questions:        How satisfied are you that the doctor(s) explained things relating to your relative's illness in a straightforward, honest manner during the past month?       How satisfied are you that the doctor(s) explained things relating to your relative's illness in a way you could understand during the past month?       How satisfied are you that you received consistent information about your relative's condition from all the doctors and nurses looking after him or her during the past month?       How satisfied are you that you received updates about your relative's condition, treatments, test results, etc. in a timely manner during the past month?       How satisfied are you that the doctor(s) listened to what you had to say during the past month?       How satisfied are you with discussions during the past month with the doctor(s) about where your relative would be cared for (in hospital, at home, or elsewhere) if he or she were to get worse?     Note: The "Communication and Decision Making" domain is one of six domains comprising the CANHELP Caregiver Questionnaire. Mean scale scores are calculated for each domain of the questionnaire. In addition, an "Overall" satisfaction score is calculated. Please note that there is another version of the surveyCANHELP Liteavailable from the CARENET Web site.Initiatives to improve satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care remain hampered by a nascent understanding of what quality care means to patients and their families, and how it is best measured. Several experts and professional societies have attempted to define the specific components and related areas (domains) involved in quality EOL care; in contrast, patient and family perspectives are surprisingly lacking.   Most previous studies of quality have focused on outpatients and people with cancer. Researchers recently documented that most Canadians (greater than 70%) die in hospitals, and the majority of decedents are elderly patients who died from causes unrelated to cancer. The trajectory of a patient dying from cancer differs from one dying from other, chronic, end-stage medical conditions. Thus, issues deemed important to quality EOL care that were identified by previous investigators may not be generalizable to seriously ill patients with advanced disease other than cancer, who have a more uncertain prognosis.   Although a "quality death" is an espoused right of Canadians, for many dying patients and their families it is not achieved. Recent reviews and observational studies describe considerable dissatisfaction with EOL care, indicating that there are still opportunities for improvement. Ideally, initiatives aimed at improving EOL care would be informed by the experiences and expectations of patients and their family members. However, such efforts are often hampered by inadequate definitions of quality of care and by suboptimal tools for measurement.   In a recent review, few studies evaluated satisfaction with care at the EOL, and most used non-validated assessment tools. To advance this field, standardized, validated satisfaction questionnaires are needed to measure meaningful outcomes in order to evaluate the effects of various clinical, organizational, policy, and financial initiatives that influence how EOL care is delivered and experienced. By first understanding patients' and families' levels of satisfaction with key elements of EOL care, we will be in a better position to improve their individual care, and to introduce quality improvement initiatives to the health care system as needed.   The Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire was designed to help researchers, health care providers, patients, and their families better understand satisfaction with care provided to seriously ill patients with advanced disease and to identify opportunities for improvement.

NQMC-5617	This measure is used to assess the satisfaction with care of family members of patients in the intensive care unit based upon their responses to the "Family Satisfaction with Decision-making Around Care of Critically Ill Patients" scale on the Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit (FS-ICU 24) questionnaire.In the intensive care unit (ICU), patient-centered care includes family-centered care. Since most ICU patients cannot make decisions for themselves, families are often involved as surrogate decision makers. Therefore, the perspectives of family and other surrogate decision makers are especially important in the critical care setting, and family satisfaction is an important outcome measure.  Families have an important role in sharing relevant information, for example: what transpired before the admission; what kind of person the patient is; and, perhaps most importantly, what the patient would want in terms of care, given the current situation.   A key domain of quality of care is satisfaction with care. Because desirable health status outcomes may not be attained after critical illness and because mortality rates in tertiary referral ICUs may approach 15% to 20%, satisfaction with care is important not only to patients but also to their families. Furthermore, given that the majority of critically ill patients (especially those at high risk for poor outcomes) are unable to participate in decision making about treatments, the family's perspective is central to understanding (and measuring) satisfaction with care in the ICU.  Respondents' answers to the "Family Satisfaction with Decision-making Around Care of Critically Ill Patients" on the Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit (FS-ICU 24) questionnaire (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Family members of intensive care unit patients who completed the Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit (FS-ICU 24) questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

NQMC-6477	This measure is used to assess the parent's report of the length of time that he or she has been bringing his or her child to a regular place or physician, based on the parent's responses ("0 = no particular place [person]," "1 = less than 6 months," "2 = 6 months to 1 year," "3 = 1 to 2 years," "4 = 3 to 5 years," and "5 = greater than 5 years") to the "Longitudinal Continuity" items in the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument:        If there is one particular place that you take your child for almost all his/her healthcare how long has this been your child's place for healthcare?       If there is one particular person that you think of as your child's regular doctor or nurse, how long has this person been your child's doctor or nurse?   High quality pediatric primary care is a cornerstone of efforts to improve health outcomes, control health care spending, and improve access to care. To improve the quality of pediatric primary care, a reliable and valid measure must exist. The ideal instrument is one that is brief, practical, reliable, and valid. Given the current high rate of uninsured children and children without a regular source of care, such an instrument must also be applicable regardless of insurance status and health plan membership or the presence of a regular provider of care.  The Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure is based on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) definition of primary care, which is similar to the American Academy of Pediatrics concept of a medical home. With the use of this definition as a criterion, the P3C was designed to measure 6 components of care (longitudinal continuity, access, contextual knowledge, communication, comprehensiveness, and coordination) that, when present, constitute high-quality primary care experiences. High scores reflect care conforming to this a priori definition.   The P3C measures perceptions of quality based on parents' reports of their experiences, rather than ratings of satisfaction with those experiences. The P3C was designed to measure parents' perceptions of experiences in receiving primary care, rather than the quality of a particular provider of primary care. This was done so that the care received by children without a regular provider also could be described in relation to the IOM definition of quality primary care. This is important, given the large proportions of uninsured children and children without a regular source of care who receive primary health care at emergency departments or community clinics, where they might not see a consistent provider. The number of responses ("0 = no particular place [person]," "1 = less than 6 months," "2 = 6 months to 1 year," "3 = 1 to 2 years," "4 = 3 to 5 years," and "5 = greater than 5 years") to the "Longitudinal Continuity" items in the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Children whose parent or guardian answered the "Longitudinal Continuity" items on the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument

NQMC-2091	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adult patients who reported how often they wanted to be more involved in making decisions about their mental health treatment.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Mental Health Services Module.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction    Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall.

NQMC-8557	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult home health care patients who reported how well their home health care provider communicated with patients.  The "Communications Between Providers and Patients" composite measure is based on six questions in the Home Health Care CAHPS Survey. Two of the questions ask patients whether ("Yes" or "No"):        When you first started getting home health care from this agency, did someone from the agency tell you what care and services you would get?       In the last 2 months of care, when you contacted this agency's office did you get the help or advice you needed?     AND  Three of the questions ask patients how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always"):        In the last 2 months of care, how often did home health providers from this agency keep you informed about when they would arrive at your home?       In the last 2 months of care, how often did home health providers from this agency explain things in a way that was easy to understand?       In the last 2 months of care, how often did home health providers from this agency listen carefully to you?     AND  One question asks patients how often ("Same day," "1 to 5 days," "6 to 14 days," "More than 14 days"):        When you contacted this agency's office, how long did it take for you to get the help or advice you needed?     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Home Health Care Survey (HHCAHPS) is designed to measure the experiences of people receiving home health care from Medicare-certified home health care agencies. The HHCAHPS Survey will be conducted for home health agencies by approved HHCAHPS vendors.   The survey is designed to meet the following three broad goals:        To produce comparable data on the patient's perspective that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between home health agencies on domains that are important to consumers.       Public reporting of survey results will create incentives for agencies to improve their quality of care.       Public reporting will enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of care provided in return for public investment.    The number of "Yes" or "No" and "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always" and "Same day," "1 to 5 days," "6 to 14 days," or "More than 14 days" responses on the "Communications Between Providers and Patients" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Home health care patients age 18 years and older who answered the "Communications Between Providers and Patients" questions on the Home Health Care CAHPS Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

NQMC-8614	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult inpatients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always") the area around their room was quiet at night.   The "Quietness of Hospital Environment" measure is based on one question on the CAHPS Hospital Survey.The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey is part of a larger Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) program sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). CAHPS was initiated by AHRQ in 1995 to establish survey and reporting products that provide consumers with information on health plan and provider performance. Since 1995, the initiative has grown to include a range of health care services at multiple levels of the delivery system. HCAHPS was developed by AHRQ in response to the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services' (CMS) request for a survey that supports the assessment of patients' perspectives on hospital care.   The purpose of HCAHPS is to uniformly measure and publicly report patients' perspectives on their inpatient care. While many hospitals collected information on patients' satisfaction with care, there was no national standard for collecting this information that would yield valid comparisons across all hospitals. HCAHPS represents the first national standard for the collection of information on patients' perspectives about their inpatient care.  Three broad goals have shaped the HCAHPS survey. First, the survey is designed to produce comparable data on patients' perspectives of care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between hospitals on domains that are important to consumers. Second, public reporting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care. Third, public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of hospital care provided in return for the public investment. With these goals in mind, the HCAHPS project has taken substantial steps to assure that the survey is credible, useful, and practical. This methodology and the information it generates is made available to the public. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always" responses on the "Quietness of Hospital Environment" question (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Hospital inpatients with an admission during the reporting period who answered the "Quietness of Hospital Environment" question on the CAHPS Hospital Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-3045	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who indicated how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their nephrologist:        listened carefully to them.       explained things in a way that was easy to understand.       showed respect for what they had to say.       spent enough time with them.       really cared about them as a person.     AND  The percentage of respondents who indicated whether ("Yes" or "No") their nephrologist:        seemed informed and up-to-date about the health care they received from other doctors.     The "Nephrologists' Communication and Caring" composite measure is based on six questions in the CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey.  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.As a result of legislation passed in 1972, Medicare pays for more than two-thirds of the expenditures for care for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To help ensure that these patients are receiving quality care, the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) has been reporting comparative clinical information at the facility level since January of 2001 on its Dialysis Facility Compare Web site. However, patient survey results are noticeably absent from the current set of quality measures for ESRD care. In recent years, both the U.S. Office of the Inspector General and MedPac's 2003 Report to Congress noted the need to evaluate the experience of care for ESRD patients.  Consequently, in late 2002, CMS requested that the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the CAHPS grantees produce a patient survey for in-center hemodialysis patients.  This request was part of CMS's broader quality agenda for its ESRD program.    The CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey is designed to assess the experiences of hemodialysis patients who receive care from dialysis facilities. It is intended to serve as a tool that both facilities and End-Stage Renal Disease Networks can use to measure and improve the patient-centeredness of their care. The number of responses ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always" OR "Yes" or "No") on the "Nephrologists' Communication and Caring" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All currently dialyzing in-center hemodialysis patients, age 18 years and older, who answered the "Nephrologists' Communication and Caring" questions on the CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-851	This single-item measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") they were given information about patient rights.Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.  The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies. This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:        To satisfy external standards.       To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.       To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.       To hold providers accountable through public reporting.    The number of health plan members from the denominator who indicated "Yes" or "No" regarding whether they were given information on patient rights Health plan members age 18 years and older, enrolled in a managed care organization (MCO) or managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) for the previous 12 months with no more than one break in enrollment of up to 45 days during the enrollment period, who received behavioral health care services and who answered the "Getting Information About Patient Rights" question on the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey
NQMC-2076	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adult patients who reported whether their substance use counselors explained to them in a way they could understand how their substance use treatment (for example, methadone) and their HIV medications might interact.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Outpatient Substance Use Treatment Module.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction    Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall. The number of patients who indicated "Strongly Disagree," "Disagree," "Agree," "Strongly Agree," or "Does Not Apply" to the item, "My substance use counselors explained to me in a way I could understand how my substance use treatment (for example, methadone) and my HIV medications might interact." HIV positive adult patients 18 years of age and older engaged in a substance use treatment program who completed the survey
NQMC-7478	This measure is used to assess the percentage of parents/guardians (respondents) who reported if ("Yes, definitely," "Yes, somewhat," or "No") their child's providers communicated well.   This "How Well Providers Communicate with Patients" composite measure is based on six questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child Visit Survey that asks whether:        Provider explained things in a way that was easy to understand       Provider listened carefully to respondent       Provider gave easy to understand information about health questions or concerns       Provider knew important information about child's medical history       Provider showed respect for what respondent had to say       Provider spent enough time with child     The Visit Survey is meant to capture information about a patient's most recent visit. However, only questions about provider communication and office staff ask about the most recent visit. Questions about access to care use a 12-month reference period.  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Visit Survey asks patients to report on their experiences with providers and office staff at their most recent visit to a provider's office. This instrument addresses feedback from many users regarding the need for a CAHPS survey that focuses on experiences during a single visit rather than over a period of time. More targeted feedback about a visit can provide medical practices with valuable information for monitoring and improvement. Also, many physicians are accustomed to seeing survey results for a visit, which they sometimes perceive as more valid and credible. The number of "Yes, definitely," "Yes, somewhat," or "No" responses on the "How Well Providers Communicate with Patients" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All parents/guardians who answered the "How Well Providers Communicate with Patients" questions on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child Visit Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-7398	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who reported how often/whether their family member's nursing home provided information and encouraged respondent involvement.   This "Nursing Home Provides Information/Encourages Respondent Involvement" composite measure is based on six questions in the CAHPS Nursing Home Family Member Survey. Four questions ask respondents (defined as family members of nursing home residents) how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always"):        Nurses/Aides give respondent timely information about resident       Nurses/Aides explain things to respondent       Respondent involved in decisions about care       Respondent given information about payments/expenses     AND  Two questions ask respondents whether ("Yes" or "No"):        Nurses/Aides discourage respondents questions       Respondent stops self from complaining     The Family Member Survey asks respondents to report on their own experiences (not the resident's) with the nursing home and their perceptions of the quality of care provided to a family member living in a nursing home. This instrument is designed to be administered by mail.  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level (nursing home) reporting.The CAHPS Nursing Home Surveys include three instruments designed to provide information on the experiences of nursing home residents and their family members. Multiple versions of the Nursing Home Surveys are available to meet different needs:        Long-Stay Resident Survey       Discharged Resident       Family Member Survey     The Nursing Home Surveys can be used in monitoring programs designed to improve both care quality and patient satisfaction.  Although the family members do not receive care from the nursing home, their experiences at the nursing home and with staff are important in describing the quality of the nursing home. Family members often help choose the nursing home and continue to be involved with their family member after entry, participating in care planning and making decisions on behalf of the resident. Like the CAHPS Nursing Home Resident Surveys, the family reported experiences of care complement other, publicly reported data such as health deficiencies, staffing, and other quality indicators (e.g., percent of residents with restraints), and thus contribute to providing a comprehensive view of quality care.  The Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services requested development of this questionnaire to complement the Long-Stay Resident Instrument especially for those residents who may be too impaired to respond for themselves. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always" and "Yes" or "No" responses on the "Nursing Home Provides Information/Encourages Respondent Involvement" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All respondents (defined as family members of nursing home residents) who answered the "Nursing Home Provides Information/Encourages Respondent Involvement" questions on the CAHPS Nursing Home Family Member Survey
NQMC-7263	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the "Illness Management" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Bereavement Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on the caregivers' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following questions:        How satisfied are you with the tests that were done and the treatments that were given for your relative's medical problems in the last month of life?       How satisfied are you that physical symptoms (for example: pain, shortness of breath, nausea) your relative had in the last month of life were adequately assessed and controlled?       How satisfied are you that emotional problems (for example: depression, anxiety) your relative had in the last month of life were adequately controlled?       How satisfied are you with the help your relative received with personal care in the last month of life (for example: bathing, toileting, dressing, eating)?       How satisfied are you that, in the last month of life, your relative received good care when you were not able to be with him/her?       How satisfied are you with home care services your relative received in the last month of life?       How satisfied are you that health care workers worked together as a team to look after your relative in the last month of life?       How satisfied are you that you were able to manage the financial costs associated with your relative's illness in the last month of life?       How satisfied are you with the environment or the surroundings in which your relative was cared for in the last month of life?       How satisfied are you that the care and treatment your relative received in the last month of life was consistent with his or her wishes?     Note: The "Illness Management" domain is one of six domains comprising the CANHELP Bereavement Questionnaire. Mean scale scores are calculated for each domain of the questionnaire. In addition, an "Overall" satisfaction score is calculated. Please note that there is another version of the surveyCANHELP Liteavailable from the CARENET Web site.Initiatives to improve satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care remain hampered by a nascent understanding of what quality care means to patients and their families, and how it is best measured. Several experts and professional societies have attempted to define the specific components and related areas (domains) involved in quality EOL care; in contrast, patient and family perspectives are surprisingly lacking.   Most previous studies of quality have focused on outpatients and people with cancer. Researchers recently documented that most Canadians (greater than 70%) die in hospitals, and the majority of decedents are elderly patients who died from causes unrelated to cancer. The trajectory of a patient dying from cancer differs from one dying from other, chronic, end-stage medical conditions. Thus, issues deemed important to quality EOL care that were identified by previous investigators may not be generalizable to seriously ill patients with advanced disease other than cancer, who have a more uncertain prognosis.   Although a "quality death" is an espoused right of Canadians, for many dying patients and their families it is not achieved. Recent reviews and observational studies describe considerable dissatisfaction with EOL care, indicating that there are still opportunities for improvement. Ideally, initiatives aimed at improving EOL care would be informed by the experiences and expectations of patients and their family members. However, such efforts are often hampered by inadequate definitions of quality of care and by suboptimal tools for measurement.   In a recent review, few studies evaluated satisfaction with care at the EOL, and most used non-validated assessment tools. To advance this field, standardized, validated satisfaction questionnaires are needed to measure meaningful outcomes in order to evaluate the effects of various clinical, organizational, policy, and financial initiatives that influence how EOL care is delivered and experienced. By first understanding patients' and families' levels of satisfaction with key elements of EOL care, we will be in a better position to improve their individual care, and to introduce quality improvement initiatives to the health care system as needed.   The Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire was designed to help researchers, health care providers, patients, and their families better understand satisfaction with care provided to seriously ill patients with advanced disease and to identify opportunities for improvement. Caregivers' ratings on the "Illness Management" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Bereavement Questionnaire (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of questions answered by caregivers who completed the "Illness Management" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Bereavement Questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-7465	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") they were able to get timely appointments, needed care, and information.   This "Getting Timely Appointments, Care, and Information" composite measure is based on five questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult Visit Survey that asks how often:        Patient got appointment for urgent care as soon as needed       Patient got appointment for non-urgent care as soon as needed       Patient got answer to medical question the same day he/she phoned provider's office       Patient got answer to medical question as soon as he/she needed when phoned provider's office after hours       Patient saw provider within 15 minutes of appointment time     The Visit Survey is meant to capture information about a patient's most recent visit. However, only questions about provider communication and office staff ask about the most recent visit. Questions about access to care use a 12-month reference period.  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Visit Survey asks patients to report on their experiences with providers and office staff at their most recent visit to a provider's office. This instrument addresses feedback from many users regarding the need for a CAHPS survey that focuses on experiences during a single visit rather than over a period of time. More targeted feedback about a visit can provide medical practices with valuable information for monitoring and improvement. Also, many physicians are accustomed to seeing survey results for a visit, which they sometimes perceive as more valid and credible. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" responses on the "Getting Timely Appointments, Care, and Information" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "Getting Timely Appointments, Care, and Information" questions on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult Visit Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-268	This measure assesses the mean score for the questions in the "Overall Assessment" section of the Emergency Department Survey.    The "Overall Assessment" section is one of eight sections that comprise the Emergency Department Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Healthcare employee satisfaction and retention           Healthcare facility competitive market strength           Hospital profitability           Risk management (likelihood of being sued)                The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Overall Assessment" section of the Emergency Department Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Emergency Department Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details. Patients with an emergency department (ED) visit during the reporting period who answered at least one question in the "Overall Assessment" section of the Emergency Department Survey. Deceased patients, patients admitted to hospital through the ED, patients who leave the ED against medical advice, patients who leave the ED without being seen, and patients transferred to another hospital/institution are not eligible.
NQMC-2058	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adolescent and adult patients who reported how often their life ran more smoothly overall because of the help they got from their case manager.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Case Management Module.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction    Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall. The number of patients who indicated "All of the time," "Most times," "Sometimes," "Rarely," "Never," or "Does not apply" to the item, "Overall, my life ran more smoothly because of the help I got from my case manager." HIV positive adolescents and adults 13 years of age and older who had at least 2 HIV case management visits in the last 12 months and completed the survey
NQMC-4536	This measure is used to assess adult enrollees' perceptions of all the health care they received from their health plan. Enrollees rate care on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst health care possible and 10 is the best health care possible. Responses are grouped by rating: percentages are reported for ratings of 9 and 10, 7 and 8, and 6 and lower.    Note: The percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 (or sometimes 8, 9, and 10) is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care. The CAHPS consortium began by developing the CAHPS Health Plan Survey, an integrated set of carefully tested and standardized questionnaires and report formats that can be used to produce meaningful, reliable, and comparable information about the experiences of consumers enrolled in health plans.    The CAHPS Health Plan Survey is designed to generate information that consumers can use to choose health plans, that purchasers can use to assess the value of services they buy, and that health plans can use to assess their performance and improve their products and services. As AHRQ had intended, the survey can be used with all types of health insurance consumers--including Medicaid recipients, Medicare beneficiaries, and those who are commercially insured--and across the full range of health care delivery systems, from fee-for-service to managed care plans. The instruments also capture information about special groups, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities and families with children.    The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires health plans to submit measures from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey as part of their HEDIS submission and for accreditation purposes. Member's ratings of all the health care they received on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst health care possible and 10 is the best health care possible (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Health plan members age 18 years and older who answered the "Rating of All Health Care" question on the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 4.0 (Adult Questionnaire) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-9094	The CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Child Version provides information on parents' or guardians' experience with their child's health plan for the population of children with chronic conditions (CCC). Results include the same ratings, composites and individual question summary rates as those reported for the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Child Version.  In addition, three CCC composites summarize satisfaction with basic components of care essential for successful treatment, management and support of children with chronic conditions.        Access to Specialized Services       Family Centered Care: Personal Doctor Who Knows Child       Coordination of Care for Children with Chronic Conditions     Item-specific question summary rates are reported for each composite question. Question summary rates are also reported individually for two items summarizing the following concepts:        Access to Prescription Medicines       Family Centered Care: Getting Needed Information     For this "Family Centered Care: Getting Needed Information" measure, parents or guardians of children with chronic conditions indicate how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their children's doctor or other health providers answered their questions regarding their child. The "Family Centered Care: Getting Needed Information" measure is based on one question in the CAHPS 5.0H Child Questionnaire.The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. Survey results give health plans the opportunity for continuous improvement in member care. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually,"and "Always" responses on the "Family Centered Care: Getting Needed Information" question (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Eligible health plan members with chronic conditions 17 years and younger whose parent or guardian answered the "Family Centered Care: Getting Needed Information" question on the CAHPS 5.0H Child Questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-2299	This measure is used to assess the mean score for the questions in the "Hospice Team" section of the Hospice Services Survey.    The "Hospice Team" section is one of five sections that comprise the Hospice Services Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988, 1744) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).      Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction           Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)                The mean of all the family members' scores for the questions from the "Hospice Team" section of the Hospice Services Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Hospice Services Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details.

NQMC-7552	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score for the "Leadership Commitment" items on the Communication Climate Assessment Toolkit (C-CAT) Patient (or Pediatric) Survey and Staff Survey.   This composite comprises 7 items on the Patient (or Pediatric) Survey and 16 items on the Staff Survey:   Patient (or Pediatric) Survey         Was it easy to ask questions at the hospital (clinic)?       Was information in the waiting areas helpful?       Was it easy to reach someone on the phone if you had a question?       Do you feel welcome at the hospital (clinic)?       Are you happy with the care you get at the hospital (clinic)?       Does the hospital (clinic) communicate well with patients?       Would you bring a family member to this hospital (clinic)?     Staff Survey         Senior leaders have taken steps to create a more welcoming environment for patients.       Senior leaders have taken steps to promote a more patient-centered environment.       Senior leaders have made effective communication with diverse populations a priority.       Senior leaders have rewarded staff and departments that work to improve communication.       My direct supervisors have intervened if staff were not respectful towards patients.       My direct supervisors have asked for my suggestions on how to improve communication within the hospital (clinic).       My direct supervisors have used my feedback to improve communication within the hospital (clinic).       Hospital (clinic) staff members have shown that they care about communicating effectively with diverse populations.       Hospital (clinic) staff members have spoken openly with supervisors about any miscommunications.       Hospital (clinic) staff members have known whom to call if they have a problem or suggestion.       Hospital (clinic) staff members have communicated well with patients over the phone.       Hospital (clinic) staff members have communicated with each other respectfully.       Hospital (clinic) staff members have communicated with each other effectively to ensure high quality care.       Hospital (clinic) staff members have needed more time to communicate well with patients.       Have you ever received specific and adequate training on communication policies at the hospital (clinic)?       Have you ever received specific and adequate training on the impact of miscommunication on patient safety?     This measure is one of nine composite measures derived from the C-CAT. Effective communication is the foundation for quality health care. Communication between health care practitioners, patients, and other members of care teams affects patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment recommendations, and patient safety. According to the Joint Commission, miscommunication is the leading cause of sentinel events (serious medical errors). In addition, health and health care disparities are created when miscommunication disproportionately affects certain patient populations. As a result, understanding and improving communication may be a key to addressing disparities, which is an important national health policy goal.  Patient-centered communication is well recognized as a key to quality care, and an organization's climate and infrastructure can affect communication in a number of important ways. We developed a set of assessment tools to measure a hospital or clinic's organizational climate specifically in regard to patient-centered communication. The tools provide a 360 evaluation of organizational communication climate and include patient and staff surveys that can be used to derive standardized domain scores in each of 9 key areas of organizational communication climate.  An organization should routinely examine its commitment, capacity and efforts to meet the communication needs of the populations it serves, including leadership involvement; mission, goals, and strategies; policies and programs; budget allocations; and workforce values.

NQMC-842	This composite measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who indicated how much of a problem ("Not a problem," "A small problem," or "A big problem") they had getting treatment and information from their health plan or managed behavior health organization (MBHO). The "Getting Treatment and Information from the Plan or MBHO" composite measure is based on six questions for patients enrolled in managed care organizations and two questions for patient's enrolled in MBHOs on the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey.    Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.  Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.  The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies. This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:        To satisfy external standards.       To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.       To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.       To hold providers accountable through public reporting.    The number of health plan members from the denominator who indicated "Not a problem," "A small problem," or "A big problem" on the questions regarding their experiences in getting treatment and information Health plan members age 18 years and older, enrolled in a managed care organization (MCO) or managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) for the previous 12 months with no more than one break in enrollment of up to 45 days during the enrollment period, who received behavioral care services and who answered the "Getting Treatment and Information from the Plan or MBHO" questions on the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey
NQMC-7460	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") they were able to get timely appointments, needed care, and information.   This "Getting Timely Appointments, Care, and Information" composite measure is based on five questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult 12-Month Survey that asks how often:        Patient got appointment for urgent care as soon as needed       Patient got appointment for non-urgent care as soon as needed       Patient got answer to medical question the same day he/she phoned provider's office       Patient got answer to medical question as soon as he/she needed when phoned provider's office after hours       Patient saw provider within 15 minutes of appointment time     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The 12-month version of the CG-CAHPS asks patients to report on their experiences with a provider's officeboth the health care provider they see and the office staffover the last 12 months. This reference period of 12 months prompts respondents to consider multiple experiences with care when answering the questions. It is also consistent with the 12-month reference period for the commercial version of the Health Plan Survey. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" responses on the "Getting Timely Appointments, Care, and Information" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "Getting Timely Appointments, Care, and Information" questions on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult 12-Month Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-7489	This individual items measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") their provider gave them information about care and other appointments.   This "Information about Care and Appointments" measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult 12-Month Survey with Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Items:        Did this provider's office give you information about what to do if you needed care during evenings, weekends, or holidays?       Some offices remind patients between visits about tests, treatment or appointments. In the last 12 months, did you get any reminders from this provider's office between visits?     This survey combines the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey with the PCMH Item Set to address the domains of the medical home.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     To address interest in assessing patient experience with the patient-centered medical home model, the CAHPS Consortium has developed an extended version of the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey that incorporates the CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Item Set. The item set expands on existing CG-CAHPS survey domains and adds questions in other domains to address key elements of the medical home model.  The PCMH is a model for delivering primary care that is patient-centered, comprehensive, coordinated, accessible, and continuously improved through a systems-based approach to quality and safety.  Primary care practices throughout the U.S. are implementing the medical home model. To evaluate the impact of implementing this model, health care organizations and public agencies are investigating how it affects the effectiveness, efficiency, and patient-centeredness of care. The number of "Yes" or "No" responses on each ofthe "Information about Care and Appointments" questions:        Did this provider's office give you information about what to do if you needed care during evenings, weekends, or holidays?       Some offices remind patients between visits about tests, treatment or appointments. In the last 12 months, did you get any reminders from this provider's office between visits?     See the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.

NQMC-2055	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adolescent and adult patients who reported how often they wanted to be more involved in making decisions about their service plan and goals.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Case Management Module.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction    Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall. The number of patients who indicated "All of the time," "Most times," "Sometimes," "Rarely," "Never," or "Does not apply" to the item, "I wanted to be more involved in making decisions about my service plan and goals." HIV positive adolescents and adults 13 years of age and older who had at least 2 HIV case management visits in the last 12 months and completed the survey
NQMC-8963	This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their providers communicated well about medications.  This "How Well Providers Communicate About Medicines" composite measure is based on four questions from the CAHPS Addressing Health Literacy Item Set consisting of supplemental items designed for use with the CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey. The four questions ask how often:        Provider gave easy-to-understand instructions about taking medicines       Provider gave easy-to-understand explanations about possible side effects of medicines       Provider gave easy-to-understand written information about medicines       Provider suggested ways to help patient remember to take medicines     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The CAHPS Addressing Health Literacy Item Set consists of supplemental items designed for use with the CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys. It was developed to provide health care providers with data that could help them improve their health literacy practices.  The survey can be used to:         Identify specific topic areas for quality improvement (e.g., communication about test results, medications, and forms).       Recognize particular behaviors that inhibit effective communication (e.g., talking too fast, using medical jargon).       Assist in designing a safer, shame-free environment where patients feel comfortable discussing their health care concerns (e.g., showing interest in questions, explaining forms).       Measure the effect of behaviors that promote effective communication (e.g., confirming understanding through teach-back, using visual aids).     Only 12 percent of U.S. adults have proficient health literacy. More than a third of U.S. adults77 million peoplehave difficulty with common health tasks, such as following directions on a prescription drug label or adhering to a childhood immunization schedule using a standard chart. Moreover, complex health information can overwhelm even individuals with proficient health literacy skills. Research has shown that health information often exceeds individuals' health literacy capabilities.  Recent years have seen an increased awareness of the mismatch between patients' skills and the health literacy demands that are placed on them. There is also a growing recognition that health care professionals have a responsibility to improve patients' understanding of what they are being told and what they need to do to care for themselves. The Joint Commission, for example, issued a call to action in its 2007 white paper, "What Did the Doctor Say?" Improving Health Literacy to Protect Patient Safety.  When providers work to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in patient experience in care, they should consider that cultural, language, and health literacy barriers may partially explain the observed disparities. (Haviland, 2012) Therefore, the CAHPS Item Set for Addressing Health Literacy is intended to serve as both a measure of whether health care professionals have succeeded in reducing the health literacy demands they place on patients, and as a tool for quality improvement and closing the disparity gap. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" responses on the "How Well Providers Communicate About Medicines" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "How Well Providers Communicate About Medicines" questions from the Addressing Health Literacy Item Set on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-854	This single-item measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") the care they received was responsive to their cultural needs.Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment.

NQMC-3047	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who indicated whether ("Yes" or "No"):        they know how to take care of their graft, fistula or catheter.       the dialysis center ever gave them any written information about their rights as a patient.       the dialysis center staff at the center ever reviewed their rights as a patient with them.       the dialysis center staff ever told them what to do if they experienced a health problem at home.       any dialysis center staff ever told them how to get off the machine if there is an emergency at the center.       their kidney doctors or dialysis center staff talked to them as much as they wanted about which treatment is right for them.       their doctor or dialysis center staff explained to them why they are not eligible for a kidney transplant.       their kidney doctors or dialysis center staff talked to them about peritoneal dialysis.       they were as involved as much as they wanted in choosing the treatment for kidney disease that is right for them.     The "Providing Information to Patients" composite measure is based on nine questions in the CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey.  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.As a result of legislation passed in 1972, Medicare pays for more than two-thirds of the expenditures for care for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To help ensure that these patients are receiving quality care, the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) has been reporting comparative clinical information at the facility level since January of 2001 on its Dialysis Facility Compare Web site. However, patient survey results are noticeably absent from the current set of quality measures for ESRD care. In recent years, both the U.S. Office of the Inspector General and MedPac's 2003 Report to Congress noted the need to evaluate the experience of care for ESRD patients.  Consequently, in late 2002, CMS requested that the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the CAHPS grantees produce a patient survey for in-center hemodialysis patients.  This request was part of CMS's broader quality agenda for its ESRD program.    The CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey is designed to assess the experiences of hemodialysis patients who receive care from dialysis facilities. It is intended to serve as a tool that both facilities and End-Stage Renal Disease Networks can use to measure and improve the patient-centeredness of their care. The number of responses ("Yes" or "No") on the "Providing Information to Patients" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All currently dialyzing in-center hemodialysis patients, age 18 years and older, who answered the "Providing Information to Patients" questions on the CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

NQMC-4546	This measure is used to assess parents' or guardians' perceptions of their child's specialist. Parents rate their child's specialist on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst specialist possible and 10 is the best specialist possible. Responses are grouped by rating: percentages are reported for ratings of 9 and 10, 7 and 8, and 6 and lower.    Note: The percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 (or sometimes 8, 9, and 10) is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care. The CAHPS consortium began by developing the CAHPS Health Plan Survey, an integrated set of carefully tested and standardized questionnaires and report formats that can be used to produce meaningful, reliable, and comparable information about the experiences of consumers enrolled in health plans.    The CAHPS Health Plan Survey is designed to generate information that consumers can use to choose health plans, that purchasers can use to assess the value of services they buy, and that health plans can use to assess their performance and improve their products and services. As AHRQ had intended, the survey can be used with all types of health insurance consumers--including Medicaid recipients, Medicare beneficiaries, and those who are commercially insured--and across the full range of health care delivery systems, from fee-for-service to managed care plans. The instruments also capture information about special groups, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities and families with children.    The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires health plans to submit measures from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey as part of their HEDIS submission and for accreditation purposes. Parents' or guardians' ratings of their child's specialist on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst specialist possible and 10 is the best specialist possible (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Health plan members age 17 years and younger whose parent or guardian answered the "Rating of Specialist" question on the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 4.0 (Child Questionnaire) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-2239	This measure is used to assess the mean score for the questions in the "Admission" section of the Inpatient Pediatric Survey.    The "Admission" section is one of ten sections that comprise the Inpatient Pediatric Survey.  Mean section scores are reported for each section of this survey.  In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.          Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).      It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).      Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction           Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)                The mean of all the parents' scores for the questions from the "Admission" section of the Inpatient Pediatric Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Inpatient Pediatric Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details.   Parents of patients with an inpatient pediatric care admission discharged during the reporting period who answered at least one question in the "Admission" section of the Inpatient Pediatric Survey.  All deceased patients and newborns are excluded from sampling.
NQMC-5032	The "Effectiveness" scale* on the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) is used to assess the level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the (perceived) "Effectiveness" of medication. This composite scale is comprised of two items on the TSQM survey:        How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the ability of the medication to prevent or treat the condition?       How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the way the medication relieves symptoms?     *Note: The validity of this scale is influenced by the degree to which patients can; a) use personal experience to assess the effectiveness of their medication, b) has information on the clinical effectiveness of their medication (e.g., clinician appraisal, lab results etc.) and c) has formulated perceptions/beliefs about its effectiveness. Of note, patients' satisfaction and medication behavior may be the result of erroneous beliefs about the effectiveness of their medication. Moreover, medications may take time before they begin to work and TSQM assessments should be made after patients have had a chance to fully evaluate their medication.  Note: The "Side Effects" scale is a component of a composite measure. It cannot be used on its own and must be used with the following scales:        "Side Effects" scale of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM): the mean scale score for the "Side Effects" items on the TSQM (version II).       "Convenience" scale of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM): the mean scale score for the "Convenience" items on the TSQM (version II).       "Global Satisfaction" scale of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM): the mean scale score for the "Global Satisfaction" items on the TSQM (version II).   Patients' dissatisfaction with treatment may act as an early indicator of non-adherence and non-persistence with medication use, thereby affecting the clinical effectiveness and efficiency of medical care. Patients who perceive their medication to be ineffective, laden with side effects (see the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse [NQMC] summary, "Side Effects" scale of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM): the mean scale score for the "Side Effects" items on the TSQM (version II)), very inconvenient (see the related NQMC summary, "Convenience" scale of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM): the mean scale score for the "Convenience" items on the TSQM (version II)), or as having more negative than positive characteristics (see the related NQMC summary, "Global Satisfaction" scale of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM): the mean scale score for the "Global Satisfaction" items on the TSQM (version II)) are less likely to fill prescriptions or take their medications as prescribed. This in turn can impact the effectiveness of treatment and may result in service inefficiencies associated with treatment failure.  Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) provides a unique opportunity to compare medications on three primary dimensions (Effectiveness, Side Effects, Convenience), as well as evaluate the relative importance of these primary dimensions to patients using overall rating of Global Satisfaction. Routine assessment of patients' level of TS-M provides a way for clinicians to screen individuals whose current medication experiences may increase the risk of poor medication adherence and weak persistence. In aggregate, TSQM scores can foster a deeper consideration of patients' perspectives when evaluating the merits and drawbacks of various treatment alternatives. The number of "Extremely Dissatisfied," "Very Dissatisfied," "Dissatisfied," "Somewhat Satisfied," "Satisfied," "Very Satisfied," and "Extremely Satisfied" responses for the "Effectiveness" items on the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication. From the responses, a scale score is calculated with a higher score indicating greater satisfaction. Patients who completed the "Effectiveness" items on the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM)
NQMC-840	This composite measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who indicated how often ("Always," "Usually," "Sometimes," or "Never") they obtained treatment without long waits. The "Getting Treatment Quickly" composite measure is based on three questions on the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey.    Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.  Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.  The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies. This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:        To satisfy external standards.       To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.       To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.       To hold providers accountable through public reporting.    The number of health plan members from the denominator who indicated "Always," "Usually," "Sometimes," or "Never" on the three questions regarding their experiences getting treatment without long waits Health plan members age 18 years and older, enrolled in a managed care organization (MCO) or managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) for the previous 12 months with no more than one break in enrollment of up to 45 days during the enrollment period, who received behavioral health care services and who answered the "Getting Treatment Quickly" questions on the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey
NQMC-6482	This measure is used to assess the parent's report of the physician's knowledge of other visits and visits to specialists, as well as the follow-up of problems through subsequent visits or phone calls, based on the parent's responses ("0 = never," "1 = sometimes," "2 = often," "3 = almost always," "4 = always," "NA = Not applicable") to the "Coordination" items in the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument:        When necessary, can the doctor arrange for other health care for your child?       When necessary, do you feel that the doctor follows up on visits to other health care providers?       Do you feel the doctor communicates with other health providers about your child, when necessary?       When necessary, do the doctor and the school work together for your child's health?   High quality pediatric primary care is a cornerstone of efforts to improve health outcomes, control health care spending, and improve access to care. To improve the quality of pediatric primary care, a reliable and valid measure must exist. The ideal instrument is one that is brief, practical, reliable, and valid. Given the current high rate of uninsured children and children without a regular source of care, such an instrument must also be applicable regardless of insurance status and health plan membership or the presence of a regular provider of care.  The Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure is based on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) definition of primary care, which is similar to the American Academy of Pediatrics concept of a medical home. With the use of this definition as a criterion, the P3C was designed to measure 6 components of care (longitudinal continuity, access, contextual knowledge, communication, comprehensiveness, and coordination) that, when present, constitute high-quality primary care experiences. High scores reflect care conforming to this a priori definition.  The P3C measures perceptions of quality based on parents' reports of their experiences, rather than ratings of satisfaction with those experiences. The P3C was designed to measure parents' perceptions of experiences in receiving primary care, rather than the quality of a particular provider of primary care. This was done so that the care received by children without a regular provider also could be described in relation to the IOM definition of quality primary care. This is important, given the large proportions of uninsured children and children without a regular source of care who receive primary health care at emergency departments or community clinics, where they might not see a consistent provider.  Although some have argued that patients/parents cannot report on the coordination of care, it could be argued that the best coordination is apparent to the patient or parentthat part of coordinating care involves communicating the process and outcomes of that coordination to the parent. The number of responses ("0 = never," "1 = sometimes," "2 = often," "3 = almost always," "4 = always," "NA = Not applicable") to the "Coordination" items in the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)  Children whose parent or guardian answered the "Coordination" items on the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument
NQMC-261	This measure assesses the mean score for the questions in the "Arrival" section of the Emergency Department Survey.    The "Arrival" section is one of eight sections that comprise the Emergency Department Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.

Patients with an emergency department (ED) visit during the reporting period who answered at least one question in the "Arrival" section of the Emergency Department Survey. Deceased patients, patients admitted to hospital through the ED, patients who leave the ED against medical advice, patients who leave the ED without being seen, and patients transferred to another hospital/institution are not eligible.
NQMC-7481	This measure indicates the percentage of patients/guardians (respondents) who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") their child's provider talked about keeping their child from getting injured, the food the child eats, physical activity, and household problems.  This "Provider's Advice on Keeping Your Child Safe and Healthy" composite measure is based on five questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child Visit Survey that asks whether:        Respondent and provider talked about injury prevention       Provider gave information on injury prevention       Respondent and provider talked about child's eating habits       Respondent and provider talked about child's physical activity       Respondent and provider talked about any problems in the household that might affect child     The Visit Survey is meant to capture information about a patient's most recent visit.  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Visit Survey asks patients to report on their experiences with providers and office staff at their most recent visit to a provider's office. This instrument addresses feedback from many users regarding the need for a CAHPS survey that focuses on experiences during a single visit rather than over a period of time. More targeted feedback about a visit can provide medical practices with valuable information for monitoring and improvement. Also, many physicians are accustomed to seeing survey results for a visit, which they sometimes perceive as more valid and credible. The number of "Yes" or "No" responses on the "Provider's Advice on Keeping Your Child Safe and Healthy" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All parents/guardians who answered the "Provider's Advice on Keeping Your Child Safe and Healthy" questions on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child Visit Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-8632	The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Child Version provides information on parents' experience with their child's practice. Results summarize patient experiences through an overall rating question, composites and individual question summary rates.  For this "Comprehensiveness - Child Prevention" measure, parents or guardians reported whether ("Yes" or "No") their child received comprehensive preventive healthcare. The "Comprehensiveness - Child Prevention" composite measure is based on six questions in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Child Version:        Q42: In the last 12 months, did you and anyone in this provider's office talk about things you can do to keep your child from getting injured?       Q43: In the last 12 months, did anyone in this provider's office give you information about how to keep your child from getting injured?       Q44: In the last 12 months, did you and anyone in this provider's office talk about how much time your child spends on a computer and in front of a TV?       Q45: In the last 12 months, did you and anyone in this provider's office talk about how much or what kind of food your child eats?       Q46: In the last 12 months, did you and anyone in this provider's office talk about how much or what kind of exercise your child gets?       Q48: In the last 12 months, did you and anyone in this provider's office talk about whether there are any problems in your household that might affect your child?   The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome.

NQMC-8956	This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients who reported if ("Yes, definitely," "Yes, somewhat," or "No") their provider was caring and inspired trust.  The "Providers Are Caring and Inspire Trust" composite measure is based on five questions from the CAHPS Cultural Competence Item Set consisting of supplemental items designed for use with the CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys. The five questions ask whether:        Patient could tell provider anything       Patient could trust provider with medical care       Provider always told patient truth about health       Provider cared as much as patient about health       Provider cared about patient as a person     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Cultural Competence Item Set was developed to improve the ability of the CG-CAHPS to assess the cultural competence of providers; the item set expands on existing survey domains and adds questions in other domains of cultural competency that were not adequately addressed in the existing surveys.  This item set is intended to generate data that health care providers can use to improve their cultural competence by:        Identifying specific topic areas for quality improvement.       Recognizing particular behaviors that inhibit effective communication.       Measuring the effect of behaviors that promote effective communication.     The evidence of significant racial and ethnic disparities in access to health care, outcomes, and health status among racial and ethnic minorities is well documented. Among the strategies that have been advocated for reducing racial and ethnic differences in patient experiences with care is the provision of "culturally competent" medical care. Culturally competent care is defined as care that is responsive to diversity in the patient population and cultural factors that can affect health and health care, such as language, communication styles, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. To be culturally competent, health care providers have to employ various interpersonal and organizational strategies that bridge barriers to communication and understanding that stem from racial, ethnic, cultural, and linguistic differences.  Cultural competency supplemental items can help providers identify, by racial/ethnic groups, which aspects of patients' experiences may be affecting scores on the Clinician  Group Surveys core communication composite measure ("How Well Providers Communicate with Patients").

NQMC-5231	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult dental plan patients who indicated how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") or whether or not ("Definitely Yes," "Somewhat Yes," "Somewhat No," or "Definitely No") they had a good experience with dental plan costs and services. This measure summarizes answers to survey questions that asked people:        How often did their dental plan cover all of the services they thought were covered?       How often did the 800 number, written materials or website provide the information they wanted?       How often did their dental plan's customer service give you the information or help you needed?       How often did their dental plan's customer service staff treat you with courtesy and respect?       Did their dental plan cover what you and your family needed to get done?       Did this information (from their dental plan) help them find a dentist they were happy with?     The "Dental Plan Costs and Services" composite measure is based on six questions in the CAHPS Dental Plan Survey.  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.Patient satisfaction is a common subject in the dental literature, and this partly seems to result from the unique nature of dental care.  Patients tend to suffer from a fair amount of anxiety related to dental care - most notably with respect to the pain and discomfort associated (at least subjectively) with many dental procedures. One survey in Kentucky found that 40% of the population reported dental fear, with 17% reporting high dental fear.  In that same study, 52% of the population were of the opinion that "pain" was the main reason that people were afraid of the dentist.    The literature also shows that the level of distress, anxiety, or fear appear to influence patients' evaluations of dentists' behaviors and patients' satisfaction with care.  Level of anxiety has even been shown to influence the kind of communication style preferred by the patient.    Pain itself is an important dimension of the dental patient experience, and it has been shown to influence care-seeking and compliance with treatment, increase feelings of helplessness, and predict patterns of health service utilization; patients' descriptions of pain can influence clinical judgments and treatment decisions (e.g., how much pain relief is offered to the patient).  Patients view pain as a "discrete assessable component" of dental treatment.    Communication has been shown to be a significant influence on patient satisfaction.  Several studies emphasize the importance of dentist-patient interaction during the dental encounter - especially in terms of what has been labeled "communicative involvement" in one study.  Communicatively involved dentists appear attentive, perceptive, and responsive to patients' comments and needs; they establish rapport, discuss treatment plans and options, and help elaborate and confirm the patient's understanding of their treatment encounter.   This kind of open, interactive communication has been shown to improve the patient's overall satisfaction with their dental provider.    In addition, it has been generally shown that a dentist's "chairside manner" significantly influences dental care outcomes such as patients' satisfaction, anxiety, and willingness to return for further treatment.  Patients who receive incomplete, general, or impersonal information regarding their condition of treatment tend to perceive their dentist as hostile.  This desire for information reflects the desire patients have to play a collaborative role in decision-making regarding their dental care, although many perceive that they play a passive role in treatment decisions.  In some cases, however, some patients (e.g., those who suffer from particularly high anxiety) do show a preference for interaction marked by "communicative dominance" on the practitioner's part, which refers to the extent to which the dentist controls the nature and topics of the encounter.    Another dimension is satisfaction with the results of dental treatment.  This dimension is to some extent concentrated in the specialty area of prosthodontics - the sub-field that deals with the restoration and replacement of teeth (e.g., fitting of dentures, implants, and bridges) - although these satisfaction concerns do span other areas of dentistry.  This dimension includes basic (improvement in) comfort experienced by the patient as a result of dental work, the functionality of prosthodontic dental work (e.g., in eating or chewing, or phonetics), as well as the overall appearance, or aesthetics, of prosthodontics.   The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always" responses and "Definitely Yes," "Somewhat Yes," "Somewhat No," or "Definitely No" responses on the "Dental Plan Costs and Services" questions    From the responses, a composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Dental plan patients age 18 years and older who answered the "Dental Plan Costs and Services" questions on the CAHPS Dental Plan Survey
NQMC-9066	The CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Adult Version provides information on the experiences of commercial and Medicaid members with the health plan and gives a general indication of how well the health plan meets members' expectations. Results summarize member satisfaction through ratings, composites and question summary rates.  Four global rating questions reflect overall satisfaction.        Rating of All Health Care       Rating of Personal Doctor       Rating of Specialist Seen Most Often       Rating of Health Plan     For this "Rating of All Health Care" measure, members rate all health care received on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the "worst health care possible" and 10 is the "best health care possible".The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. Survey results give health plans the opportunity for continuous improvement in member care. Member's ratings of all health care received on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the "worst health care possible" and 10 is the "best health care possible" (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Eligible health plan members 18 years and older who answered the "Rating of All Health Care" question on the CAHPS 5.0H Adult Questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-6913	This measure assesses the mean score for the fourquestions in the "Personal Issues" section of the Medical Practice Survey.  The "Personal Issues" section is one of six sections that comprise the Medical Practice Survey. Each patient has a score for every question that was answered. For each patient, a section score is calculated as the mean of all the question scores in that particular section. Similarly, for each patient, an overall score is calculated as the mean of that patient's section scores.Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care and a component of quality care.   In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that:  "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' 'individual needs,' rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: 'Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately.' In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care... Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that '...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends' (from Press [2002], Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).   It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).  Patient satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: clinical quality (e.g., hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); chronic disease control; compliance; drug complications; quality of life; emotional health status; mental health; physical functioning; physical health status; post-surgery complications; post-surgery recovery times; risk-adjusted mortality rates; unexpected mortality; and work effectiveness (Clark, Drain,  Malone, 2004).  In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction has been linked to the following:         Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; volume; physician satisfaction; patient's trust in provider; retention; employee satisfaction.       Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in expenses; reduction in length of stay; reduction in complaints; reduction in malpractice claims; direct measures of financial performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain,  Malone, 2004).    The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Personal Issues" section of the Medical Practice Survey Patients who go for a scheduled or unscheduled doctor visit  Alternatively, visits may be with a non-physician provider such as a physician assistant (PA) or a nurse practitioner (NP). Typically, the patient has an established relationship with their care provider.  See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.
NQMC-3176	This measure assesses the mean score for the questions in the "Nurses" section of the Inpatient Survey.    The "Nurses" section is one of ten sections that comprise the Inpatient Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.

NQMC-2063	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adult patients who reported how often their substance use counselors were responsible and professional.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Outpatient Substance Use Treatment Module.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction    Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall.

NQMC-8959	This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") they received timely answers to medical questions by email.  The "Getting Timely Answers to Medical Questions by Email" composite measure is based on two questions from the CAHPS Health Information Technology (Health IT) Item Set consisting of supplemental items designed for use with the CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey. The two questions ask how often:        Provider answered your emailed medical question as soon as you needed       Provider answered all of your emailed questions     Note: This composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Health Information Technology (Health IT) Item Set is designed for use with the CG-CAHPS to assess a variety of aspects of health IT.  This item set is intended to collect data that health care providers can use to improve care by:        Identifying specific topic areas for quality improvement.       Recognizing particular behaviors or actions that inhibit the effective use of health IT.       Measuring the effect of behaviors that promote the effective use of health IT.     There are many local, regional, and national initiatives to accelerate the adoption of health IT. Because of the associated changes in the delivery of care, assessing the use of health IT from the patient's perspective is important.  While the technology has the potential to improve communication and access for patients, some studies have reported negative outcomes, such as depersonalization of the provider visit. The CAHPS Consortium developed items that would assess aspects of the use of health IT for which patients are the best or only source of information. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" responses on the "Getting Timely Answers to Medical Questions by Email" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "Getting Timely Answers to Medical Questions by Email" questions from the Health Information Technology Item Set on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-4539	This measure is used to assess adult enrollees' perceptions of their health plan. Enrollees rate their health plan on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst health plan possible and 10 is the best health plan possible. Responses are grouped by rating: percentages are reported for ratings of 9 and 10, 7 and 8, and 6 and lower.    Note: The percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 (or sometimes 8, 9, and 10) is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care. The CAHPS consortium began by developing the CAHPS Health Plan Survey, an integrated set of carefully tested and standardized questionnaires and report formats that can be used to produce meaningful, reliable, and comparable information about the experiences of consumers enrolled in health plans.    The CAHPS Health Plan Survey is designed to generate information that consumers can use to choose health plans, that purchasers can use to assess the value of services they buy, and that health plans can use to assess their performance and improve their products and services. As AHRQ had intended, the survey can be used with all types of health insurance consumers--including Medicaid recipients, Medicare beneficiaries, and those who are commercially insured--and across the full range of health care delivery systems, from fee-for-service to managed care plans. The instruments also capture information about special groups, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities and families with children.    The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires health plans to submit measures from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey as part of their HEDIS submission and for accreditation purposes. Member's ratings of their health plan on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst health plan possible and 10 is the best health plan possible (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Health plan members age 18 years and older who answered the "Rating of Health Plan" question on the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 4.0 (Adult Questionnaire) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

NQMC-846	This measure indicates adult patients' perceptions of their health plan for counseling or treatment. Patients rate the health plan on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst plan possible and 10 is the best plan possible.  Responses are grouped by rating: percentages are reported for ratings of 9 and 10, 7 and 8, and 6 and lower.    Note: The percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 (or sometimes 8, 9, and 10) is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.  Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.  The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies. This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:        To satisfy external standards.       To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.       To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.       To hold providers accountable through public reporting.    To report ratings of 9 and 10:  The number of health plan members from the denominator who rated their health plan for counseling or treatment a 9 or 10    To report ratings of 7 and 8:  The number of health plan members from the denominator who rated their health plan for counseling or treatment a 7 or 8    To report ratings of 6 or lower:  The number of health plan members from the denominator who rated their health plan for counseling or treatment a 6 or lower   Health plan members age 18 years and older, enrolled in a managed care organization (MCO) for the previous 12 months with no more than one break in enrollment of up to 45 days during the enrollment period, who received behavioral health care services and who answered the "Overall Rating of the Health Plan" question on the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey

NQMC-230	This measure assesses the mean score on seven items asking about the helpfulness of office staff, overall rating of care and whether doctor/other providers listen carefully, explain things clearly, respect   you, and spend enough time.Health behaviors, such as alcohol use and drunk driving, sexual activity, depression, suicide, smoking, violence, and guns are the primary causes of morbidity and mortality among adolescents. Preventive counseling and screening on these and other health risk topics are the centerpiece of adolescent preventive services guidelines. Common components in adolescent preventive services guidelines set forth by the American Medical Association (AMA), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the U.S. Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) include:       Periodic adolescent health care visits specifically     focused on preventive screening and counseling.       Private and confidential care whereby adolescents can     meet privately with providers with assurances of confidentiality.       Education and counseling on behavioral, emotional,     and medical risks to health. This includes encouraging good health habits     (e.g., healthy eating, physical activity) and providing guidance on avoiding     risky behaviors (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, unprotected sexual activity,     drunk driving, ignoring or reacting inappropriately to negative emotions, use     of drugs, violence, and guns).       Screening, early identification and referrals for behavioral, emotional, and medical risks. This includes screening for smoking, alcohol, sexual activity, depression, street drug use, involvement in or victim of violence or abuse, access to and use of guns, and unsafe practices such as infrequent helmet and seatbelt use or driving in a care with a driver who has been drinking alcohol.    Studies demonstrate that adolescents trust health care providers. Adolescents are interested and willing to talk with providers about recommended preventive counseling and screening topics, especially during private, confidential health care visits. Yet, for many reasons, including young adult access barriers to care and provider training and incentives, few adolescents receive recommended comprehensive preventive counseling and screening services on key topics such as alcohol use, depression, sexual activity, smoking, injury prevention, physical activity, and diet.    Among other strategies, performance measurement can be a powerful component of efforts to improve preventive services for adolescents. Experts and consumers emphasize the importance of adolescent preventive care as a top priority for health care system accountability and performance reporting, and point to the current lack of measurement methods. While the rate at which adolescents have yearly well-visits is being used by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) as a national indicator of quality for health maintenance organizations, this measure provides no information about the provision of preventive counseling and screening nor takes into account the fact that preventive services are often provided outside the context of well-visits.    The Young Adult Health Care Survey (YAHCS) was developed to complement existing performance measurement methods. This 45-item survey was designed to provide a parsimonious, comprehensive and actionable assessment of adherence to adolescent preventive counseling and screening guidelines.

NQMC-7464	This individual item measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their provider's office followed up with them about results of a blood test, x-ray, or other test.   This "Individual Item: Follow up on Test Results" measure is based on one question in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys Adult 12-Month Survey that asks how often:        Someone from provider's office followed up with patient to give results of blood test, x-ray, or other test   The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The 12-month version of the CG-CAHPS asks patients to report on their experiences with a provider's officeboth the health care provider they see and the office staffover the last 12 months. This reference period of 12 months prompts respondents to consider multiple experiences with care when answering the questions. It is also consistent with the 12-month reference period for the commercial version of the Health Plan Survey. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" responses on the "Individual Item: Follow up on Test Results" question (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All adult patients who answered the "Individual Item: Follow up on Test Results" question on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult 12-Month Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-3174	This measure assesses the mean score for the questions in the "Room" section of the Inpatient Survey.    The "Room" section is one of ten sections that comprise the Inpatient Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).      Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction           Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)                The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Room" section of the Inpatient Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Inpatient Survey: Calculation of Room Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details. Patients with an inpatient admission during the reporting period who answered at least one question in the "Room" section of the Inpatient Survey.

NQMC-4542	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who indicated how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their child's personal doctor:        Explained things in a way that was easy for them to understand       Listened carefully to them       Showed respect for what they had to say       Explained things in a way that was easy for their child to understand       Spent enough time with them     The "How Well Doctors Communicate" composite measure is based on five questions in the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 4.0 (Child Questionnaire).  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care. The CAHPS consortium began by developing the CAHPS Health Plan Survey, an integrated set of carefully tested and standardized questionnaires and report formats that can be used to produce meaningful, reliable, and comparable information about the experiences of consumers enrolled in health plans.    The CAHPS Health Plan Survey is designed to generate information that consumers can use to choose health plans, that purchasers can use to assess the value of services they buy, and that health plans can use to assess their performance and improve their products and services. As AHRQ had intended, the survey can be used with all types of health insurance consumers--including Medicaid recipients, Medicare beneficiaries, and those who are commercially insured--and across the full range of health care delivery systems, from fee-for-service to managed care plans. The instruments also capture information about special groups, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities and families with children.    The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires health plans to submit measures from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey as part of their HEDIS submission and for accreditation purposes. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always" responses on the "How Well Doctors Communicate" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Health plan members age 17 years and younger whose parent or guardian answered the "How Well Doctors Communicate" questions on the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 4.0 (Child Questionnaire) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction     Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall. The number of patients who indicated "Definitely Yes," "Maybe," "Definitely Not," or "Not Sure" to the item, "If I knew a woman who was HIV-positive and needed medical care, I would refer her to this program." HIV positive female patients 13 years of age and older who had at least 2 primary care visits in the last 12 months and completed the survey
NQMC-8615	This measure is used to assess adult inpatients' overall rating of this hospital during their stay. Patients rate the hospital on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst hospital possible and 10 is the best hospital possible.The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey is part of a larger Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) program sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). CAHPS was initiated by AHRQ in 1995 to establish survey and reporting products that provide consumers with information on health plan and provider performance. Since 1995, the initiative has grown to include a range of health care services at multiple levels of the delivery system. HCAHPS was developed by AHRQ in response to the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services' (CMS) request for a survey that supports the assessment of patients' perspectives on hospital care.   The purpose of HCAHPS is to uniformly measure and publicly report patients' perspectives on their inpatient care. While many hospitals collected information on patients' satisfaction with care, there was no national standard for collecting this information that would yield valid comparisons across all hospitals. HCAHPS represents the first national standard for the collection of information on patients' perspectives about their inpatient care.  Three broad goals have shaped the HCAHPS survey. First, the survey is designed to produce comparable data on patients' perspectives of care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between hospitals on domains that are important to consumers. Second, public reporting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care. Third, public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of hospital care provided in return for the public investment. With these goals in mind, the HCAHPS project has taken substantial steps to assure that the survey is credible, useful, and practical. This methodology and the information it generates is made available to the public. Adult inpatients' overall rating of this hospital on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst hospital possible and 10 is the best hospital possible  Hospital inpatients with an admission during the reporting period who answered the "Overall Rating of Hospital" question on the CAHPS Hospital Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

NQMC-6439	This measure is used to assess the percentage of surgical patients who indicated whether ("Yes, definitely", "Yes, somewhat", or "No") their surgeon or a health provider from this surgeon's office gave them information to help them prepare for surgery.  The "Information to Help You Prepare for Surgery" composite measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey that asks patients whether their surgeon or a health provider from this surgeon's office:        Gave all the information they needed before surgery       Gave easy to understand instructions     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Surgical Care Survey addresses the need to assess and improve the experiences of surgical patients. Like other CAHPS surveys, this questionnaire focuses on aspects of surgical quality that are important to patients and for which patients are the best source of information. The survey results are expected to be useful to everyone with a need for information on the quality of surgeons and surgical care, including patients, practice groups, health plans, insurers, and specialty boards.  The Surgical Care Survey expands on the current CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey, which focuses on primary and specialty care, by incorporating domains that are relevant to surgical care, such as informed consent, anesthesia care, and post-operative follow-up. The survey is unique among CAHPS surveys in that it assesses patients' experiences with surgical care in both the inpatient and outpatient settings by asking respondents about their care before, during, and after surgery.

NQMC-2300	This measure is used to assess the mean score for the questions in the "Personal Issues" section of the Hospice Services Survey.    The "Personal Issues" section is one of five sections that comprise the Hospice Services Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988, 1744) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).      Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction           Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)                The mean of all the family members' scores for the questions from the "Personal Issues" section of the Hospice Services Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Hospice Services Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details.

NQMC-8625	The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Adult Version provides information on patients' experience with practices and gives a general indication of how well a practice meets patient expectations. Results summarize patient experience with care through an overall rating question, composites and question summary rates.   For this measure, adult patients reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") someone from their provider's office followed up with them about their blood test, x-ray, or other test results. This measure is based on the following one question in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Adult Version:        Q27: In the last 12 months, when this provider ordered a blood test, x-ray, or other test for you, how often did someone from this provider's office follow up to give you those results?   The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," and "Always" responses on the question, "In the last 12 months, when this provider ordered a blood test, x-ray, or other test for you, how often did someone from this provider's office follow up to give you those results?"

NQMC-843	This composite measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who rated how much improvement they perceived in themselves ("Much better," "A little better," "About the same," "A little worse," or "Much worse"). The "Perceived Improvement" composite measure is based on four questions on the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey.    Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.  Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.  The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies. This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:        To satisfy external standards.       To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.       To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.       To hold providers accountable through public reporting.

NQMC-4552	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who reported their experiences with getting needed information about their children's care for their children with chronic conditions*.    The "Parents' Experience with Getting Needed Information about Their Child's Care" measure is based on one question on the CAHPS 4.0 Health Plan Survey (Child Questionnaire).    *Children with special health care needs are those who have a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that generally required by children.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care. The CAHPS consortium began by developing the CAHPS Health Plan Survey, an integrated set of carefully tested and standardized questionnaires and report formats that can be used to produce meaningful, reliable, and comparable information about the experiences of consumers enrolled in health plans.  The CAHPS Health Plan Survey is designed to generate information that consumers can use to choose health plans, that purchasers can use to assess the value of services they buy, and that health plans can use to assess their performance and improve their products and services. As AHRQ had intended, the survey can be used with all types of health insurance consumers--including Medicaid recipients, Medicare beneficiaries, and those who are commercially insured--and across the full range of health care delivery systems, from fee-for-service to managed care plans. The instruments also capture information about special groups, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities and families with children.  The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires health plans to submit measures from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey as part of their HEDIS submission and for accreditation purposes.  Research indicates that children with chronic conditions account for 15 to 18 percent of all children under 18, although some sponsors of the CAHPS Health Plan Survey may serve a relatively higher proportion of children with chronic conditions than is found in the general population.  While the numbers of children with chronic conditions may be small, several factors point to the need to measure and report on quality of care for this segment of the population:        Financial impact. Children with chronic conditions consume a preponderance of the health care dollars spent on children, with estimates ranging from 80 to 90 percent.       Evidence of poor quality. Researchers have found that quality of care for children with chronic conditions is often inadequate. According to studies conducted by FACCT-The Foundation for Accountability, parents of children with chronic conditions rate their experiences with care at a level that ranges from 50 percent to 80 percent of what would be considered optimal.      It is critical to assess and track quality of care for this vulnerable segment so that parents, health plans, and other survey sponsors can evaluate how well the needs of children with chronic conditions are being met and identify which aspects of care need to be improved.            Equity. The experiences that children with chronic conditions have with health plans and providers are often different from those of healthy children, who primarily rely on the health care system for preventive and acute care. Families, health plans, and policymakers need to know if quality of care is not consistent for all children and which plans are best suited to meet the needs of children with chronic conditions.       The need for relevant information. The continual needs of children with chronic conditions far exceed those of their peers, particularly with respect to the type, scope, and frequency of health care services they require. They also have a greater demand for health information, education, partnership with providers, and coordination of care. When reviewing their coverage options, the parents of these children need access to comparative performance information that is relevant to their circumstances.    The number of health plan members from the denominator whose parents indicated "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always" to the "Parents' Experience with Getting Needed Information about Their Child's Care" question (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Health plan members age 17 years and younger with chronic conditions (as determined by specific screening criteria included in the questionnaire) whose parents or guardians answered the "Parents' Experience with Getting Needed Information about Their Child's Care" question on the CAHPS 4.0 Health Plan Survey (Child Questionnaire) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-7265	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the "Your Involvement" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Bereavement Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on the caregivers' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following questions:        How satisfied are you with the level of confidence you felt in your ability to help your relative manage his/her illness in the last month of life?       How satisfied are you with discussions in the last month of your relative's life with the doctor(s) about the use of life sustaining technologies (for example: CPR or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, breathing machines, dialysis)?       How satisfied are you that you came to understand what to expect in the last month of your relative's life (for example: in terms of symptoms and comfort measures)?       How satisfied are you with your role in decision-making regarding your relative's medical care in the last month of life?       How satisfied are you with discussions with your relative, while he or she was able, about preferences for care and treatment at the end of life?       How satisfied are you that you were able to talk comfortably with your relative, while he or she was able, about dying and death?       How satisfied are you that your relationship with your relative was strengthened in the last month of life?     Note: The "Your Involvement" domain is one of six domains comprising the CANHELP Bereavement Questionnaire. Mean scale scores are calculated for each domain of the questionnaire. In addition, an "Overall" satisfaction score is calculated. Please note that there is another version of the surveyCANHELP Liteavailable from the CARENET Web site.Initiatives to improve satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care remain hampered by a nascent understanding of what quality care means to patients and their families, and how it is best measured. Several experts and professional societies have attempted to define the specific components and related areas (domains) involved in quality EOL care; in contrast, patient and family perspectives are surprisingly lacking.   Most previous studies of quality have focused on outpatients and people with cancer. Researchers recently documented that most Canadians (greater than 70%) die in hospitals, and the majority of decedents are elderly patients who died from causes unrelated to cancer. The trajectory of a patient dying from cancer differs from one dying from other, chronic, end-stage medical conditions. Thus, issues deemed important to quality EOL care that were identified by previous investigators may not be generalizable to seriously ill patients with advanced disease other than cancer, who have a more uncertain prognosis.   Although a "quality death" is an espoused right of Canadians, for many dying patients and their families it is not achieved. Recent reviews and observational studies describe considerable dissatisfaction with EOL care, indicating that there are still opportunities for improvement. Ideally, initiatives aimed at improving EOL care would be informed by the experiences and expectations of patients and their family members. However, such efforts are often hampered by inadequate definitions of quality of care and by suboptimal tools for measurement.   In a recent review, few studies evaluated satisfaction with care at the EOL, and most used non-validated assessment tools. To advance this field, standardized, validated satisfaction questionnaires are needed to measure meaningful outcomes in order to evaluate the effects of various clinical, organizational, policy, and financial initiatives that influence how EOL care is delivered and experienced. By first understanding patients' and families' levels of satisfaction with key elements of EOL care, we will be in a better position to improve their individual care, and to introduce quality improvement initiatives to the health care system as needed.   The Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire was designed to help researchers, health care providers, patients, and their families better understand satisfaction with care provided to seriously ill patients with advanced disease and to identify opportunities for improvement. Caregivers' ratings on the "Your Involvement" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Bereavement Questionnaire (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of questions answered by caregivers who completed the "Your Involvement" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Bereavement Questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-9075	The CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Adult Version provides information on the experiences of commercial and Medicaid members with the health plan and gives a general indication of how well the health plan meets members' expectations. Results summarize member satisfaction through ratings, composites and question summary rates.  Seven composite scores summarize responses in key areas.        Claims Processing (commercial only)       Customer Service       Getting Care Quickly       Getting Needed Care       How Well Doctors Communicate       Shared Decision Making       Plan Information on Costs (commercial only)     For this "Shared Decision Making" measure, members indicate how much ("Not at all," "A little," "Some," "A lot") a doctor or other health provider talked about the reasons they might want to take a medicine and the reasons they might not want to take a medicine when they talked about starting or stopping a prescription medicine, and whether ("Yes," "No") a doctor or other health provider asked them what they thought was best for them when they talked about starting or stopping a prescription medicine. The "Shared Decision Making" composite measure is based on three questions in the CAHPS 5.0H Adult Questionnaire.The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. Survey results give health plans the opportunity for continuous improvement in member care. The number of "Not at all," "A little," "Some," and "A lot" responses and the number of "Yes" and "No" responses on the "Shared Decision Making" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Eligible health plan members 18 years and older who answered the "Shared Decision Making" questions on the CAHPS 5.0H Adult Questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-6440	This measure is used to assess the percentage of surgical patients who indicated how well ("Yes, definitely", "Yes, somewhat", or "No") their surgeon communicated with them before surgery.  The "How Well Surgeon Communicates with Patients Before Surgery" composite measure is based on four questions in the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey that asks patients whether, during office visits before their surgery, the surgeon:        Listened carefully to them       Spent enough time with them       Encouraged them to ask questions       Showed respect for what they had to say     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Surgical Care Survey addresses the need to assess and improve the experiences of surgical patients. Like other CAHPS surveys, this questionnaire focuses on aspects of surgical quality that are important to patients and for which patients are the best source of information. The survey results are expected to be useful to everyone with a need for information on the quality of surgeons and surgical care, including patients, practice groups, health plans, insurers, and specialty boards.  The Surgical Care Survey expands on the current CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey, which focuses on primary and specialty care, by incorporating domains that are relevant to surgical care, such as informed consent, anesthesia care, and post-operative follow-up. The survey is unique among CAHPS surveys in that it assesses patients' experiences with surgical care in both the inpatient and outpatient settings by asking respondents about their care before, during, and after surgery. The number of respondents from the denominator who indicated "Yes, definitely", "Yes, somewhat", or "No" responses on the "How Well Surgeon Communicates with Patients Before Surgery" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients age 18 years and older who had a surgery performed during the reporting period and who answered the "How Well Surgeon Communicates with Patients Before Surgery" questions on the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-2029	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adolescent and adult patients who reported whether their providers talked to them about how to protect themselves from getting hepatitis C (Hep C) or how to avoid passing it on to others if they already had it.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Core Measures.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction    Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall. The number of patients who indicated "Yes," "No," or "Not Sure" to the item, "My providers talked to me about how to protect myself from getting hepatitis C (Hep C) or how to avoid passing it on to others if I already had it."

NQMC-8612	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult inpatients who reported whether ("Definitely No," "Probably No," "Probably Yes," or "Definitely Yes") they were willing to recommend this hospital to their friends and family.The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey is part of a larger Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) program sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). CAHPS was initiated by AHRQ in 1995 to establish survey and reporting products that provide consumers with information on health plan and provider performance. Since 1995, the initiative has grown to include a range of health care services at multiple levels of the delivery system. HCAHPS was developed by AHRQ in response to the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services' (CMS) request for a survey that supports the assessment of patients' perspectives on hospital care.   The purpose of HCAHPS is to uniformly measure and publicly report patients' perspectives on their inpatient care. While many hospitals collected information on patients' satisfaction with care, there was no national standard for collecting this information that would yield valid comparisons across all hospitals. HCAHPS represents the first national standard for the collection of information on patients' perspectives about their inpatient care.  Three broad goals have shaped the HCAHPS survey. First, the survey is designed to produce comparable data on patients' perspectives of care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between hospitals on domains that are important to consumers. Second, public reporting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care. Third, public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of hospital care provided in return for the public investment. With these goals in mind, the HCAHPS project has taken substantial steps to assure that the survey is credible, useful, and practical. This methodology and the information it generates is made available to the public. The number of "Definitely No," "Probably No," "Probably Yes," or "Definitely Yes" responses on the "Willingness to Recommend Hospital" question Hospital inpatients with an admission during the reporting period who answered the "Willingness to Recommend Hospital" question on the CAHPS Hospital Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field
NQMC-5241	This measure is used to assess patients' or parents' or caregivers' assessment of the patient's satisfaction with their physician's office at the most recent visit. Patients rate the office on a scale of "0" to "10," where "0" is the worst possible care and "10" is the best possible care on the following items:         Total care: Ability to get all the care for your health care problem or illness at this clinic       Same MD: Ability to see the health care provider you wanted to see at this clinic       After hours: Getting the advice or help you needed after office hours       Convenience: Patient convenience such as ample parking and location of office       Staff: Friendliness and courtesy of the office staff     Note: A mean scale score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality.  See the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summary of the related DrScore measure Patients' satisfaction with care: patients' overall rating of their physician.Patient satisfaction surveys may help advance the improvement of care in a physician practice by helping physicians pinpoint areas for improvement and by providing the opportunity to benchmark a practice's quality of care. In addition, surveys address a social desire for patient representation in quality assessment in a service-oriented economy. As a result, the past years have seen a steady increase in satisfaction surveys in varying physician settings, a trend that has been aided by the use of convenient and novel computer technology, including the use of online surveys and report automation. Patients' or parents' or caregivers' ratings of the office on a scale of "0" to "10," where "0" is the worst possible care and "10" is the best possible care Patients or parents or caregivers of the patient who answered the "Office Scale" items on the DrScore Survey following the most recent visit with the doctor (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-2075	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adult patients who reported whether their substance use counselors understood where they were with their recovery and helped them to reduce or eliminate their drug use.

NQMC-855	This single-item measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who reported how much they were helped ("A lot," "Somewhat," "A little," or "Not at all") by the counseling or treatment they received.    Note: For consumer-level reporting, results may be reported as the percentage of the "A lot" plus "Somewhat" responses or the percentage of the "A lot" responses.  Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all response choices (i.e., "A lot," "Somewhat," "A little," or "Not at all") are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.  The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies. This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:        To satisfy external standards.       To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.       To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.       To hold providers accountable through public reporting.

A mean scale score is calculated based on the caregivers' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following questions:        How satisfied are you that you knew the doctor(s) in charge of your relative's care during the past month?       How satisfied are you that the doctor(s) took a personal interest in your relative during the past month?       How satisfied are you that the doctor(s) were available when you or your relative needed them (by phone or in person) during the past month?       How satisfied are you with the level of trust and confidence you had in the doctor(s) who looked after your relative during the past month?     Note: The "Relationship with the Doctors" domain is one of six domains comprising the CANHELP Caregiver Questionnaire. Mean scale scores are calculated for each domain of the questionnaire. In addition, an "Overall" satisfaction score is calculated. Please note that there is another version of the surveyCANHELP Liteavailable from the CARENET Web site.Initiatives to improve satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care remain hampered by a nascent understanding of what quality care means to patients and their families, and how it is best measured. Several experts and professional societies have attempted to define the specific components and related areas (domains) involved in quality EOL care; in contrast, patient and family perspectives are surprisingly lacking.   Most previous studies of quality have focused on outpatients and people with cancer. Researchers recently documented that most Canadians (greater than 70%) die in hospitals, and the majority of decedents are elderly patients who died from causes unrelated to cancer. The trajectory of a patient dying from cancer differs from one dying from other, chronic, end-stage medical conditions. Thus, issues deemed important to quality EOL care that were identified by previous investigators may not be generalizable to seriously ill patients with advanced disease other than cancer, who have a more uncertain prognosis.   Although a "quality death" is an espoused right of Canadians, for many dying patients and their families it is not achieved. Recent reviews and observational studies describe considerable dissatisfaction with EOL care, indicating that there are still opportunities for improvement. Ideally, initiatives aimed at improving EOL care would be informed by the experiences and expectations of patients and their family members. However, such efforts are often hampered by inadequate definitions of quality of care and by suboptimal tools for measurement.   In a recent review, few studies evaluated satisfaction with care at the EOL, and most used non-validated assessment tools. To advance this field, standardized, validated satisfaction questionnaires are needed to measure meaningful outcomes in order to evaluate the effects of various clinical, organizational, policy, and financial initiatives that influence how EOL care is delivered and experienced. By first understanding patients' and families' levels of satisfaction with key elements of EOL care, we will be in a better position to improve their individual care, and to introduce quality improvement initiatives to the health care system as needed.   The Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire was designed to help researchers, health care providers, patients, and their families better understand satisfaction with care provided to seriously ill patients with advanced disease and to identify opportunities for improvement.

NQMC-5233	This measure is used to assess adult dental plan patients' perceptions of their dental care. Patients rate dental care received on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst dental care possible and 10 is the best dental care possible.   Note: Typically, the percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.Patient satisfaction is a common subject in the dental literature, and this partly seems to result from the unique nature of dental care.  Patients tend to suffer from a fair amount of anxiety related to dental care - most notably with respect to the pain and discomfort associated (at least subjectively) with many dental procedures. One survey in Kentucky found that 40% of the population reported dental fear, with 17% reporting high dental fear.  In that same study, 52% of the population were of the opinion that "pain" was the main reason that people were afraid of the dentist.    The literature also shows that the level of distress, anxiety, or fear appear to influence patients' evaluations of dentists' behaviors and patients' satisfaction with care.  Level of anxiety has even been shown to influence the kind of communication style preferred by the patient.    Pain itself is an important dimension of the dental patient experience, and it has been shown to influence care-seeking and compliance with treatment, increase feelings of helplessness, and predict patterns of health service utilization; patients' descriptions of pain can influence clinical judgments and treatment decisions (e.g., how much pain relief is offered to the patient).  Patients view pain as a "discrete assessable component" of dental treatment.    Communication has been shown to be a significant influence on patient satisfaction.  Several studies emphasize the importance of dentist-patient interaction during the dental encounter - especially in terms of what has been labeled "communicative involvement" in one study.  Communicatively involved dentists appear attentive, perceptive, and responsive to patients' comments and needs; they establish rapport, discuss treatment plans and options, and help elaborate and confirm the patient's understanding of their treatment encounter.   This kind of open, interactive communication has been shown to improve the patient's overall satisfaction with their dental provider.    In addition, it has been generally shown that a dentist's "chairside manner" significantly influences dental care outcomes such as patients' satisfaction, anxiety, and willingness to return for further treatment.  Patients who receive incomplete, general, or impersonal information regarding their condition of treatment tend to perceive their dentist as hostile.  This desire for information reflects the desire patients have to play a collaborative role in decision-making regarding their dental care, although many perceive that they play a passive role in treatment decisions.  In some cases, however, some patients (e.g., those who suffer from particularly high anxiety) do show a preference for interaction marked by "communicative dominance" on the practitioner's part, which refers to the extent to which the dentist controls the nature and topics of the encounter.    Another dimension is satisfaction with the results of dental treatment.  This dimension is to some extent concentrated in the specialty area of prosthodontics - the sub-field that deals with the restoration and replacement of teeth (e.g., fitting of dentures, implants, and bridges) - although these satisfaction concerns do span other areas of dentistry.  This dimension includes basic (improvement in) comfort experienced by the patient as a result of dental work, the functionality of prosthodontic dental work (e.g., in eating or chewing, or phonetics), as well as the overall appearance, or aesthetics, of prosthodontics.   Patients' ratings of their dental care they received on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst dental care possible and 10 is the best dental care possible.  Note: Higher ratings indicate better quality. Dental plan patients age 18 years and older who answered the "Overall Ratings - Dental Care" question on the CAHPS Dental Plan Survey

NQMC-2033	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adolescent and adult patients who reported whether their providers asked them about how they were eating and made a referral to a nutritionist if needed.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Core Measures.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction    Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall. The number of patients who indicated "Yes," "No," or "Not Sure" to the item, "My providers asked me about how I am eating and made a referral to a nutritionist if I needed help."

NQMC-6481	This measure is used to assess the parent's report of the extent to which a regular place and/or doctor provides care for acute and chronic problems and preventive services, based on the parent's responses ("0 = never," "1 = sometimes," "2 = often," "3 = almost always," "4 = always") to the "Comprehensiveness" items in the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument:        Can the doctor take care of almost any problem you child might have?       Does the doctor talk to you about keeping your child healthy?       Does the doctor talk to you about safety (like car seats, seat belts, bike helmets, accidents)?       Does the doctor talk to you about your child's growth?       Does the doctor talk to you about behavior in general (like having friends, citizenship at school)?   High quality pediatric primary care is a cornerstone of efforts to improve health outcomes, control health care spending, and improve access to care. To improve the quality of pediatric primary care, a reliable and valid measure must exist. The ideal instrument is one that is brief, practical, reliable, and valid. Given the current high rate of uninsured children and children without a regular source of care, such an instrument must also be applicable regardless of insurance status and health plan membership or the presence of a regular provider of care.  The Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure is based on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) definition of primary care, which is similar to the American Academy of Pediatrics concept of a medical home. With the use of this definition as a criterion, the P3C was designed to measure 6 components of care (longitudinal continuity, access, contextual knowledge, communication, comprehensiveness, and coordination) that, when present, constitute high-quality primary care experiences. High scores reflect care conforming to this a priori definition.  The P3C measures perceptions of quality based on parents' reports of their experiences, rather than ratings of satisfaction with those experiences. The P3C was designed to measure parents' perceptions of experiences in receiving primary care, rather than the quality of a particular provider of primary care. This was done so that the care received by children without a regular provider also could be described in relation to the IOM definition of quality primary care. This is important, given the large proportions of uninsured children and children without a regular source of care who receive primary health care at emergency departments or community clinics, where they might not see a consistent provider. The number of responses ("0 = never," "1 = sometimes," "2 = often," "3 = almost always," "4 = always") to the "Comprehensiveness" items in the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Children whose parent or guardian answered the "Comprehensiveness" items on the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure instrument
NQMC-6912	This measure assesses the mean score for the ten questions in the "Care Provider" section of the Medical Practice Survey.  The "Care Provider" section is one of six sections that comprise the Medical Practice Survey. Each patient has a score for every question that was answered. For each patient, a section score is calculated as the mean of all the question scores in that particular section. Similarly, for each patient, an overall score is calculated as the mean of that patient's section scores.Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care and a component of quality care.   In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that:  "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' 'individual needs,' rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: 'Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately.' In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care... Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that '...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends' (from Press [2002], Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).   It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).  Patient satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: clinical quality (e.g., hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); chronic disease control; compliance; drug complications; quality of life; emotional health status; mental health; physical functioning; physical health status; post-surgery complications; post-surgery recovery times; risk-adjusted mortality rates; unexpected mortality; and work effectiveness (Clark, Drain,  Malone, 2004).  In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction has been linked to the following:         Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; volume; physician satisfaction; patient's trust in provider; retention; employee satisfaction.       Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in expenses; reduction in length of stay; reduction in complaints; reduction in malpractice claims; direct measures of financial performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain,  Malone, 2004).    The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Care Provider" section of the Medical Practice Survey  Patients who go for a scheduled or unscheduled doctor visit  Alternatively, visits may be with a non-physician provider such as a physician assistant (PA) or a nurse practitioner (NP). Typically, the patient has an established relationship with their care provider.  See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.

NQMC-8955	This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their provider was polite and considerate.  The "Providers Are Polite and Considerate" composite measure is based on three questions from the CAHPS Cultural Competence Item Set consisting of supplemental items designed for use with the CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys. The three questions ask how often:        Provider talked too fast       Provider interrupted patient when patient was talking       Provider used a condescending, sarcastic, or rude tone or manner with patient     This composite measure is intended to supplement the existing composite measure for doctor communication ("How Well Providers Communicate with Patients"), which can be calculated from the core items in the Clinician  Group Survey.  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Cultural Competence Item Set was developed to improve the ability of the CG-CAHPS to assess the cultural competence of providers; the item set expands on existing survey domains and adds questions in other domains of cultural competency that were not adequately addressed in the existing surveys.  This item set is intended to generate data that health care providers can use to improve their cultural competence by:        Identifying specific topic areas for quality improvement.       Recognizing particular behaviors that inhibit effective communication.       Measuring the effect of behaviors that promote effective communication.     The evidence of significant racial and ethnic disparities in access to health care, outcomes, and health status among racial and ethnic minorities is well documented. Among the strategies that have been advocated for reducing racial and ethnic differences in patient experiences with care is the provision of "culturally competent" medical care. Culturally competent care is defined as care that is responsive to diversity in the patient population and cultural factors that can affect health and health care, such as language, communication styles, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. To be culturally competent, health care providers have to employ various interpersonal and organizational strategies that bridge barriers to communication and understanding that stem from racial, ethnic, cultural, and linguistic differences.  Cultural competency supplemental items can help providers identify, by racial or ethic groups, which aspects of patients' experiences may be affecting scores on the Clinician  Group Survey's core communication composite measure ("How Well Providers Communicate with Patients"). The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" responses on the "Providers Are Polite and Considerate" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "Providers Are Polite and Considerate" questions from the Cultural Competence Item Set on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

NQMC-8616	The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Adult Version provides information on patients' experience with practices and gives a general indication of how well a practice meets patient expectations. Results summarize patient experience with care through an overall rating question, composites and question summary rates.   For this "Rating of Provider" measure, adult patients were asked to rate their provider on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the "worst provider possible" and 10 is the "best provider possible". Responses are grouped by rating. A question summary rate is calculated for response choices 0 to 10 individually, 8+9+10, and 9+10. The question summary rate indicates the proportion of patients who selected a particular response choice. The "Rating of Provider" measure is based on one question in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Adult Version:        Q32: Using any number from 0 to 10, where 0 is the "worst provider possible" and 10 is the "best provider possible," what number would you use to rate this provider?

Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Healthcare employee satisfaction and retention           Healthcare facility competitive market strength           Hospital profitability           Risk management (likelihood of being sued)                The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Nurses" section of the Home Health Care Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Home Health Care Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details.

NQMC-7466	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients who reported if ("Yes, definitely," "Yes, somewhat," or "No") their providers communicated well.   This "How Well Providers Communicate with Patients" composite measure is based on six questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult Visit Survey that asks whether:        Provider explained things in a way that was easy to understand       Provider listened carefully to patient       Provider gave easy to understand information about health questions or concerns       Provider knew important information about patient's medical history       Provider showed respect for what patient had to say       Provider spent enough time with patient     The Visit Survey is meant to capture information about a patient's most recent visit. However, only questions about provider communication and office staff ask about the most recent visit. Questions about access to care use a 12-month reference period.  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Visit Survey asks patients to report on their experiences with providers and office staff at their most recent visit to a provider's office. This instrument addresses feedback from many users regarding the need for a CAHPS survey that focuses on experiences during a single visit rather than over a period of time. More targeted feedback about a visit can provide medical practices with valuable information for monitoring and improvement. Also, many physicians are accustomed to seeing survey results for a visit, which they sometimes perceive as more valid and credible. The number of "Yes, definitely," "Yes, somewhat," or "No" responses on the "How Well Providers Communicate with Patients" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "How Well Providers Communicate with Patients" questions on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult Visit Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

NQMC-2298	This measure is used to assess the mean score for the questions in the "Dealing with the Hospice Office" section of the Hospice Services Survey.    The "Dealing with the Hospice Office" section is one of five sections that comprise the Hospice Services Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results.

It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).      Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction           Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)                The mean of all the family members' scores for the questions from the "Dealing with the Hospice Office" section of the Hospice Services Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Hospice Services Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details.

NQMC-8608	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult inpatients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always") the medical staff communicated well about new medications.  The "Communication about Medications" composite measure is based on two questions on the CAHPS Hospital Survey that ask patients:        Before giving you any new medicine, how often did hospital staff tell you what the medicine was for?       Before giving you any new medicine, how often did hospital staff describe possible side effects in a way you could understand?     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey is part of a larger Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) program sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). CAHPS was initiated by AHRQ in 1995 to establish survey and reporting products that provide consumers with information on health plan and provider performance. Since 1995, the initiative has grown to include a range of health care services at multiple levels of the delivery system. HCAHPS was developed by AHRQ in response to the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services' (CMS) request for a survey that supports the assessment of patients' perspectives on hospital care.   The purpose of HCAHPS is to uniformly measure and publicly report patients' perspectives on their inpatient care. While many hospitals collected information on patients' satisfaction with care, there was no national standard for collecting this information that would yield valid comparisons across all hospitals. HCAHPS represents the first national standard for the collection of information on patients' perspectives about their inpatient care.  Three broad goals have shaped the HCAHPS survey. First, the survey is designed to produce comparable data on patients' perspectives of care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between hospitals on domains that are important to consumers. Second, public reporting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care. Third, public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of hospital care provided in return for the public investment. With these goals in mind, the HCAHPS project has taken substantial steps to assure that the survey is credible, useful, and practical. This methodology and the information it generates is made available to the public.

NQMC-7555	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score for the "Health Literacy" items on the Communication Climate Assessment Toolkit (C-CAT) Patient (or Pediatric) Survey and Staff Survey.   This composite comprises 15 items on the Patient (or Pediatric) Survey and 13 items on the Staff Survey:   Patient (or Pediatric) Survey         Could you find your way around the hospital (clinic)?       Could you understand the hospital (clinic)'s signs and maps?       Was it easy to ask questions at the hospital (clinic)?       Were the hospital (clinic)'s forms easy for you to fill out?       Did hospital (clinic) staff offer to help you fill out the forms?       Did you understand the hospital (clinic)'s informed consent forms?       Were the educational materials easy to understand?       Did doctors explain things in a way you could understand?       Did doctors ask you to repeat their instructions?       Did doctors ask if you had any questions?       Did you know your main health problem?       Did you understand your doctor's instructions?       Did you know how to take your medicine?       Did you understand what hospital (clinic) staff told you over the phone?       Do you feel welcome at the hospital (clinic)?     Staff Survey         Senior leaders have taken steps to create a more welcoming environment for patients.       My direct supervisors have intervened if staff were not respectful towards patients.       Hospital (clinic) staff members have communicated well with patients over the phone.       Hospital (clinic) staff members have needed more time to communicate well with patients.       During the last 6 months, how often did relevant hospital (clinic) staff ask patients if they would like help filling out hospital forms?       Overall, how would you rate the understandability of the hospital (clinic)'s patient education materials?       Overall, how would you rate the signs and maps at the hospital (clinic)?       Overall, how would you rate the hospital (clinic)'s informed consent forms?       Overall, how would you rate the hospital (clinic)'s efforts to help patients access community resources (e.g., assistance with medications, nutrition, insurance, legal aid, etc.)?       Have you ever received specific and adequate training on communication policies at the hospital (clinic)?       Have you ever received specific and adequate training on the impact of miscommunication on patient safety?       Have you ever received specific and adequate training on the importance of communicating with patients in plain language instead of using technical terms?       Have you ever received specific and adequate training on ways to check whether patients understand instructions (such as the teach-back or the "show-me" methods)?     This measure is one of nine composite measures derived from the C-CAT. Effective communication is the foundation for quality health care. Communication between health care practitioners, patients, and other members of care teams affects patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment recommendations, and patient safety. According to the Joint Commission, miscommunication is the leading cause of sentinel events (serious medical errors). In addition, health and health care disparities are created when miscommunication disproportionately affects certain patient populations. As a result, understanding and improving communication may be a key to addressing disparities, which is an important national health policy goal.  Patient-centered communication is well recognized as a key to quality care, and an organization's climate and infrastructure can affect communication in a number of important ways. We developed a set of assessment tools to measure a hospital or clinic's organizational climate specifically in regard to patient-centered communication. The tools provide a 360 evaluation of organizational communication climate and include patient and staff surveys that can be used to derive standardized domain scores in each of 9 key areas of organizational communication climate.  An organization should consider the health literacy level of its current and potential populations and use this information to develop a strategy for the clear communication of medical information verbally, in writing and using other media.

NQMC-4538	This measure is used to assess adult enrollees' perceptions of their specialist. Enrollees rate the specialist they saw most often on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst specialist possible and 10 is the best specialist possible. Responses are grouped by rating: percentages are reported for ratings of 9 and 10, 7 and 8, and 6 and lower.    Note: The percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 (or sometimes 8, 9, and 10) is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care. The CAHPS consortium began by developing the CAHPS Health Plan Survey, an integrated set of carefully tested and standardized questionnaires and report formats that can be used to produce meaningful, reliable, and comparable information about the experiences of consumers enrolled in health plans.    The CAHPS Health Plan Survey is designed to generate information that consumers can use to choose health plans, that purchasers can use to assess the value of services they buy, and that health plans can use to assess their performance and improve their products and services.

NQMC-5230	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult dental plan patients who indicated how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") or whether or not ("Definitely Yes," "Somewhat Yes," "Somewhat No," or "Definitely No") they had a good experience with access to dental care. This measure summarizes answers to survey questions that asked people:        How often were their dental appointments as soon as they wanted?       If they tried to get an appointment for with a dentist who specializes in a particular type of dental care (such as root canals or gum disease) in the last 12 months, how often did they get an appointment as soon as they wanted?       How often did they have to spend more than 15 minutes in the waiting room before they saw someone for their appointment?       If they had to spend more than 15 minutes in the waiting room before they saw someone for your appointment, how often did someone tell them why there was a delay or how long the delay would be?       If they needed to see a dentist right away because of a dental emergency in the last 12 months, did they get to see a dentist as soon as they wanted?     The "Access to Dental Care" composite measure is based on five questions in the CAHPS Dental Plan Survey.  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.Patient satisfaction is a common subject in the dental literature, and this partly seems to result from the unique nature of dental care.  Patients tend to suffer from a fair amount of anxiety related to dental care - most notably with respect to the pain and discomfort associated (at least subjectively) with many dental procedures. One survey in Kentucky found that 40% of the population reported dental fear, with 17% reporting high dental fear.  In that same study, 52% of the population were of the opinion that "pain" was the main reason that people were afraid of the dentist.    The literature also shows that the level of distress, anxiety, or fear appear to influence patients' evaluations of dentists' behaviors and patients' satisfaction with care.  Level of anxiety has even been shown to influence the kind of communication style preferred by the patient.    Pain itself is an important dimension of the dental patient experience, and it has been shown to influence care-seeking and compliance with treatment, increase feelings of helplessness, and predict patterns of health service utilization; patients' descriptions of pain can influence clinical judgments and treatment decisions (e.g., how much pain relief is offered to the patient).  Patients view pain as a "discrete assessable component" of dental treatment.    Communication has been shown to be a significant influence on patient satisfaction.  Several studies emphasize the importance of dentist-patient interaction during the dental encounter - especially in terms of what has been labeled "communicative involvement" in one study.  Communicatively involved dentists appear attentive, perceptive, and responsive to patients' comments and needs; they establish rapport, discuss treatment plans and options, and help elaborate and confirm the patient's understanding of their treatment encounter.   This kind of open, interactive communication has been shown to improve the patient's overall satisfaction with their dental provider.    In addition, it has been generally shown that a dentist's "chairside manner" significantly influences dental care outcomes such as patients' satisfaction, anxiety, and willingness to return for further treatment.  Patients who receive incomplete, general, or impersonal information regarding their condition of treatment tend to perceive their dentist as hostile.  This desire for information reflects the desire patients have to play a collaborative role in decision-making regarding their dental care, although many perceive that they play a passive role in treatment decisions.  In some cases, however, some patients (e.g., those who suffer from particularly high anxiety) do show a preference for interaction marked by "communicative dominance" on the practitioner's part, which refers to the extent to which the dentist controls the nature and topics of the encounter.    Another dimension is satisfaction with the results of dental treatment.  This dimension is to some extent concentrated in the specialty area of prosthodontics - the sub-field that deals with the restoration and replacement of teeth (e.g., fitting of dentures, implants, and bridges) - although these satisfaction concerns do span other areas of dentistry.  This dimension includes basic (improvement in) comfort experienced by the patient as a result of dental work, the functionality of prosthodontic dental work (e.g., in eating or chewing, or phonetics), as well as the overall appearance, or aesthetics, of prosthodontics.   The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always" responses and "Definitely Yes," "Somewhat Yes," "Somewhat No," or "Definitely No" responses on the "Access to Dental Care" questions    From the responses, a composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality.

Overall, how would you rate the hospital (clinic)'s efforts to help patients access community resources (e.g., assistance with medications, nutrition, insurance, legal aid, etc.)?       Have you ever received specific and adequate training on the importance of communicating with patients in plain language instead of using technical terms?       Have you ever received specific and adequate training on how to ask patients about their health care values and beliefs?     This measure is one of nine composite measures derived from the C-CAT. Effective communication is the foundation for quality health care. Communication between health care practitioners, patients, and other members of care teams affects patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment recommendations, and patient safety. According to the Joint Commission, miscommunication is the leading cause of sentinel events (serious medical errors). In addition, health and health care disparities are created when miscommunication disproportionately affects certain patient populations. As a result, understanding and improving communication may be a key to addressing disparities, which is an important national health policy goal.  Patient-centered communication is well recognized as a key to quality care, and an organization's climate and infrastructure can affect communication in a number of important ways. We developed a set of assessment tools to measure a hospital or clinic's organizational climate specifically in regard to patient-centered communication. The tools provide a 360 evaluation of organizational communication climate and include patient and staff surveys that can be used to derive standardized domain scores in each of 9 key areas of organizational communication climate.  An organization should help its workforce engage all individuals, including those from vulnerable populations, through interpersonal communication that effectively elicits health needs, beliefs and expectations; builds trust; and conveys information that is understandable and empowering.

Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     To address interest in assessing patient experience with the patient-centered medical home model, the CAHPS Consortium has developed an extended version of the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey that incorporates the CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Item Set. The item set expands on existing CG-CAHPS survey domains and adds questions in other domains to address key elements of the medical home model.  The PCMH is a model for delivering primary care that is patient-centered, comprehensive, coordinated, accessible, and continuously improved through a systems-based approach to quality and safety.  Primary care practices throughout the U.S. are implementing the medical home model. To evaluate the impact of implementing this model, health care organizations and public agencies are investigating how it affects the effectiveness, efficiency, and patient-centeredness of care.

NQMC-7255	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the "Illness Management" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Caregiver Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on the caregivers' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following questions:        How satisfied are you with the tests that were done and the treatments that were given during the past month for your relative's medical problems?       How satisfied are you that physical symptoms (for example: pain, shortness of breath, nausea) your relative had during the past month were adequately controlled?       How satisfied are you that emotional problems (for example: depression, anxiety) your relative had during the past month were adequately controlled?       How satisfied are you with the help your relative received with personal care during the past month (for example: bathing, toileting, dressing, eating)?       How satisfied are you that, during the past month, your relative received good care when you were not able to be with him/her?       How satisfied are you with recent home care services your relative received?       How satisfied are you that health care workers worked together as a team to look after your relative during the past month?       How satisfied are you that you were able to manage the financial costs associated with your relative's illness during the past month?       How satisfied are you with the environment or the surroundings in which your relative was cared for during the past month?       How satisfied are you that the care and treatment your relative received during the past month was consistent with his or her wishes?     Note: The "Illness Management" domain is one of six domains comprising the CANHELP Caregiver Questionnaire. Mean scale scores are calculated for each domain of the questionnaire. In addition, an "Overall" satisfaction score is calculated. Please note that there is another version of the surveyCANHELP Liteavailable from the CARENET Web site.Initiatives to improve satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care remain hampered by a nascent understanding of what quality care means to patients and their families, and how it is best measured. Several experts and professional societies have attempted to define the specific components and related areas (domains) involved in quality EOL care; in contrast, patient and family perspectives are surprisingly lacking.   Most previous studies of quality have focused on outpatients and people with cancer. Researchers recently documented that most Canadians (greater than 70%) die in hospitals, and the majority of decedents are elderly patients who died from causes unrelated to cancer. The trajectory of a patient dying from cancer differs from one dying from other, chronic, end-stage medical conditions. Thus, issues deemed important to quality EOL care that were identified by previous investigators may not be generalizable to seriously ill patients with advanced disease other than cancer, who have a more uncertain prognosis.   Although a "quality death" is an espoused right of Canadians, for many dying patients and their families it is not achieved. Recent reviews and observational studies describe considerable dissatisfaction with EOL care, indicating that there are still opportunities for improvement. Ideally, initiatives aimed at improving EOL care would be informed by the experiences and expectations of patients and their family members. However, such efforts are often hampered by inadequate definitions of quality of care and by suboptimal tools for measurement.   In a recent review, few studies evaluated satisfaction with care at the EOL, and most used non-validated assessment tools. To advance this field, standardized, validated satisfaction questionnaires are needed to measure meaningful outcomes in order to evaluate the effects of various clinical, organizational, policy, and financial initiatives that influence how EOL care is delivered and experienced. By first understanding patients' and families' levels of satisfaction with key elements of EOL care, we will be in a better position to improve their individual care, and to introduce quality improvement initiatives to the health care system as needed.   The Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire was designed to help researchers, health care providers, patients, and their families better understand satisfaction with care provided to seriously ill patients with advanced disease and to identify opportunities for improvement.

NQMC-6443	This measure is used to assess the percentage of surgical patients who indicated how well ("Yes, definitely", "Yes, somewhat", or "No") their surgeon communicated with them after surgery.  The "How Well Surgeon Communicates with Patients After Surgery" composite measure is based on four questions in the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey that asks patients whether, after their surgery, the surgeon:        Listened carefully to them       Spent enough time with them       Encouraged them to ask questions       Showed respect for what they has to say     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Surgical Care Survey addresses the need to assess and improve the experiences of surgical patients. Like other CAHPS surveys, this questionnaire focuses on aspects of surgical quality that are important to patients and for which patients are the best source of information. The survey results are expected to be useful to everyone with a need for information on the quality of surgeons and surgical care, including patients, practice groups, health plans, insurers, and specialty boards.  The Surgical Care Survey expands on the current CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey, which focuses on primary and specialty care, by incorporating domains that are relevant to surgical care, such as informed consent, anesthesia care, and post-operative follow-up. The survey is unique among CAHPS surveys in that it assesses patients' experiences with surgical care in both the inpatient and outpatient settings by asking respondents about their care before, during, and after surgery.  The number of respondents from the denominator who indicated "Yes, definitely", "Yes, somewhat", or "No" responses on the "How Well Surgeon Communicates with Patients After Surgery" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients age 18 years and older who had a surgery performed during the reporting period and who answered the "How Well Surgeon Communicates with Patients After Surgery" questions on the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-848	This single-item measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") they were told about medication side effects.Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.  The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies. This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:        To satisfy external standards.       To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.       To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.       To hold providers accountable through public reporting.    The number of health plan members from the denominator who indicated "Yes" or "No" regarding whether they were told of medication side effects Health plan members age 18 years and older, enrolled in a managed care organization (MCO) or managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) for the previous 12 months with no more than one break in enrollment of up to 45 days during the enrollment period, who received behavioral health care services and who answered the "Being Told About Medication Aide Effects" question on the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey
NQMC-2037	This measure is used to assess HIV positive adolescent and adult patients' ratings of their providers' knowledge of the newest developments in HIV medical standards.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Core Measures.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction    Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall. The number of patients who indicated "Excellent," "Very Good," Average," Fair," "Poor," or "Not Sure" to the item, "I would rate my providers' knowledge of the newest developments in HIV medical standards as..." HIV positive adolescents and adults 13 years of age and older who had at least 2 HIV primary care visits in the last 12 months and completed the survey
NQMC-7483	This individual item measure indicates the percentage of parents/guardians (respondents) who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") their child's provider's office followed up with them about results of a blood test, x-ray, or other test.   This "Individual Item: Follow up on Test Results" measure is based on one question in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child Visit Survey that asks whether:        Someone from provider's office followed up with respondent to give results of blood test, x-ray, or other test     The Visit Survey is meant to capture information about a patient's most recent visit. However, only questions about provider communication and office staff ask about the most recent visit. Questions about access to care use a 12-month reference period.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Visit Survey asks patients to report on their experiences with providers and office staff at their most recent visit to a provider's office. This instrument addresses feedback from many users regarding the need for a CAHPS survey that focuses on experiences during a single visit rather than over a period of time. More targeted feedback about a visit can provide medical practices with valuable information for monitoring and improvement. Also, many physicians are accustomed to seeing survey results for a visit, which they sometimes perceive as more valid and credible. The number of "Yes" or "No" responses on the "Individual Item: Follow up on Test Results" question (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All parents/guardians who answered the "Individual Item: Follow up on Test Results" question on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child Visit Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-2092	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adult patients who reported how often their mental health providers involved their family and friends in their mental health treatment as much as they wanted.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Mental Health Services Module.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators.

NQMC-266	This measure assesses the mean score for the questions in the "Personal/Insurance Information" section of the Emergency Department Survey.    The "Personal/Insurance Information" section is one of eight sections that comprise the Emergency Department Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Healthcare employee satisfaction and retention           Healthcare facility competitive market strength           Hospital profitability           Risk management (likelihood of being sued)                The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Personal/Insurance Information" section of the Emergency Department Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Emergency Department Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details. Patients with an emergency department (ED) visit during the reporting period who answered at least one question in the "Personal/Insurance Information" section of the Emergency Department Survey. Deceased patients, patients admitted to hospital through the ED, patients who leave the ED against medical advice, patients who leave the ED without being seen, and patients transferred to another hospital/institution are not eligible.
NQMC-2062	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adult patients who reported how often they could see their substance use counselors soon enough for their needs when they needed an appointment.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Outpatient Substance Use Treatment Module.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators.

NQMC-4540	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who indicated how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") it was easy for their child to:        Get appointments with specialists       Get the care, tests, or treatment they needed through their health plan     The "Getting Needed Care" composite measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 4.0 (Child Questionnaire).  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care. The CAHPS consortium began by developing the CAHPS Health Plan Survey, an integrated set of carefully tested and standardized questionnaires and report formats that can be used to produce meaningful, reliable, and comparable information about the experiences of consumers enrolled in health plans.  The CAHPS Health Plan Survey is designed to generate information that consumers can use to choose health plans, that purchasers can use to assess the value of services they buy, and that health plans can use to assess their performance and improve their products and services. As AHRQ had intended, the survey can be used with all types of health insurance consumers--including Medicaid recipients, Medicare beneficiaries, and those who are commercially insured--and across the full range of health care delivery systems, from fee-for-service to managed care plans. The instruments also capture information about special groups, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities and families with children.  The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires health plans to submit measures from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey as part of their HEDIS submission and for accreditation purposes. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always" responses on the "Getting Needed Care" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Health plan members age 17 years and younger whose parent or guardian answered the "Getting Needed Care" questions on the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 4.0 (Child Questionnaire) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-8633	The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Child Version provides information on parents' experience with their child's practice. Results summarize patient experiences through an overall rating question, composites and individual question summary rates.  For this "Self-Management Support" measure, parents or guardians reported whether ("Yes" or "No") their child received self-management support. The "Self-Management Support" composite measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Child Version:        Q49: In the last 12 months, did anyone in this provider's office talk with you about specific goals for your child's health?       Q50: In the last 12 months, did anyone in this provider's office ask you if there are things that make it hard for you to take care of your child's health?   The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. The number of "Yes" and "No" responses on the "Self-Management Support" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Eligible patients whose parent or guardian answered the "Self-Management Support" questions on the CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Child Version (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-7254	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the "Characteristics of the Doctors and Nurses" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Caregiver Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on the caregivers' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following questions:        How satisfied are you with the level of trust and confidence you had in the nurses who looked after your relative during the past month?       How satisfied are you that the doctors and nurses who looked after your relative during the past month knew enough about his or her health problems to give the best possible care?       How satisfied are you that the doctors and nurses looking after your relative during the past month were compassionate and supportive of him or her?       How satisfied are you that the doctors and nurses looking after your relative during the past month were compassionate and supportive of you?       How satisfied are you that your relative was treated by those doctors and nurses during the past month in a manner that preserved his or her sense of dignity?     Note: The "Characteristics of the Doctors and Nurses" domain is one of six domains comprising the CANHELP Caregiver Questionnaire. Mean scale scores are calculated for each domain of the questionnaire. In addition, an "Overall" satisfaction score is calculated. Please note that there is another version of the surveyCANHELP Liteavailable from the CARENET Web site.Initiatives to improve satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care remain hampered by a nascent understanding of what quality care means to patients and their families, and how it is best measured. Several experts and professional societies have attempted to define the specific components and related areas (domains) involved in quality EOL care; in contrast, patient and family perspectives are surprisingly lacking.   Most previous studies of quality have focused on outpatients and people with cancer. Researchers recently documented that most Canadians (greater than 70%) die in hospitals, and the majority of decedents are elderly patients who died from causes unrelated to cancer. The trajectory of a patient dying from cancer differs from one dying from other, chronic, end-stage medical conditions. Thus, issues deemed important to quality EOL care that were identified by previous investigators may not be generalizable to seriously ill patients with advanced disease other than cancer, who have a more uncertain prognosis.   Although a "quality death" is an espoused right of Canadians, for many dying patients and their families it is not achieved. Recent reviews and observational studies describe considerable dissatisfaction with EOL care, indicating that there are still opportunities for improvement. Ideally, initiatives aimed at improving EOL care would be informed by the experiences and expectations of patients and their family members. However, such efforts are often hampered by inadequate definitions of quality of care and by suboptimal tools for measurement.   In a recent review, few studies evaluated satisfaction with care at the EOL, and most used non-validated assessment tools. To advance this field, standardized, validated satisfaction questionnaires are needed to measure meaningful outcomes in order to evaluate the effects of various clinical, organizational, policy, and financial initiatives that influence how EOL care is delivered and experienced. By first understanding patients' and families' levels of satisfaction with key elements of EOL care, we will be in a better position to improve their individual care, and to introduce quality improvement initiatives to the health care system as needed.   The Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire was designed to help researchers, health care providers, patients, and their families better understand satisfaction with care provided to seriously ill patients with advanced disease and to identify opportunities for improvement. Caregivers' ratings on the "Characteristics of the Doctors and Nurses" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Caregiver Questionnaire (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of questions answered by caregivers who completed the "Characteristics of the Doctors and Nurses" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Caregiver Questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

NQMC-4547	This measure is used to assess parents' or guardians' perceptions of their child's health plan. Parents rate their child's health plan on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst health plan possible and 10 is the best health plan possible. Responses are grouped by rating: percentages are reported for ratings of 9 and 10, 7 and 8, and 6 and lower.    Note: The percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 (or sometimes 8, 9, and 10) is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality.

The instruments also capture information about special groups, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities and families with children.    The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires health plans to submit measures from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey as part of their HEDIS submission and for accreditation purposes. Parents' or guardians' ratings of their child's health plan on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst health plan possible and 10 is the best health plan possible (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Health plan members age 17 years and younger whose parent or guardian answered the "Rating of Health Plan" question on the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 4.0 (Child Questionnaire) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-8621	The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Adult Version provides information on patients' experience with practices and gives a general indication of how well a practice meets patient expectations. Results summarize patient experience with care through an overall rating question, composites and question summary rates.   For this "Shared Decision Making" measure, adult patients indicate how much ("Not at all," "A little," "Some," or "A lot") their provider talked about the reasons they might want to take a medicine and the reasons they might not want to take a medicine when they talked about starting or stopping a prescription medicine, and whether ("Yes" or "No") their provider asked them what they thought was best for them when they talked about starting or stopping a prescription medicine. The "Shared Decision Making" composite measure is based on three questions in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Adult Version:        Q29: When you talked about starting or stopping a prescription medicine, how much did this provider talk about the reasons you might want to take a medicine?       Q30: When you talked about starting or stopping a prescription medicine, how much did this provider talk about the reasons you might not want to take a medicine?       Q31: When you talked about starting or stopping a prescription medicine, did this provider ask you what you thought was best for you?   The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. The number of "Not at all" or "No," "A little," "Some," and "A lot" or "Yes" responses on the "Shared Decision Making" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Eligible patients who answered the "Shared Decision Making" questions on the CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Adult Version (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-7251	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the global rating of satisfaction question 1 on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Caregiver Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on caregivers' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following question:         In general, how satisfied are you with the quality of care your relative received during the past month?     Note: Please note that there is another version of the surveyCANHELP Liteavailable from the CARENET Web site.Initiatives to improve satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care remain hampered by a nascent understanding of what quality care means to patients and their families, and how it is best measured. Several experts and professional societies have attempted to define the specific components and related areas (domains) involved in quality EOL care; in contrast, patient and family perspectives are surprisingly lacking.   Most previous studies of quality have focused on outpatients and people with cancer. Researchers recently documented that most Canadians (greater than 70%) die in hospitals, and the majority of decedents are elderly patients who died from causes unrelated to cancer. The trajectory of a patient dying from cancer differs from one dying from other, chronic, end-stage medical conditions. Thus, issues deemed important to quality EOL care that were identified by previous investigators may not be generalizable to seriously ill patients with advanced disease other than cancer, who have a more uncertain prognosis.   Although a "quality death" is an espoused right of Canadians, for many dying patients and their families it is not achieved. Recent reviews and observational studies describe considerable dissatisfaction with EOL care, indicating that there are still opportunities for improvement. Ideally, initiatives aimed at improving EOL care would be informed by the experiences and expectations of patients and their family members. However, such efforts are often hampered by inadequate definitions of quality of care and by suboptimal tools for measurement.   In a recent review, few studies evaluated satisfaction with care at the EOL, and most used non-validated assessment tools. To advance this field, standardized, validated satisfaction questionnaires are needed to measure meaningful outcomes in order to evaluate the effects of various clinical, organizational, policy, and financial initiatives that influence how EOL care is delivered and experienced. By first understanding patients' and families' levels of satisfaction with key elements of EOL care, we will be in a better position to improve their individual care, and to introduce quality improvement initiatives to the health care system as needed.   The Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire was designed to help researchers, health care providers, patients, and their families better understand satisfaction with care provided to seriously ill patients with advanced disease and to identify opportunities for improvement.

NQMC-262	This measure assesses the mean score for the questions in the "Nurses" section of the Emergency Department Survey.    The "Nurses" section is one of eight sections that comprise the Emergency Department Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Healthcare employee satisfaction and retention           Healthcare facility competitive market strength           Hospital profitability           Risk management (likelihood of being sued)                The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Nurses" section of the Emergency Department Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Emergency Department Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details.

NQMC-7476	This individual item measure indicates the percentage of parents/guardians (respondents) who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their child's provider's office followed up with them about results of a blood test, x-ray, or other test.   This "Individual Item: Follow up on Test Results" measure is based on one question in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child 12-Month Survey that asks how often:        Someone from provider's office followed up with respondent to give results of blood test, x-ray, or other test   The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The 12-month version of the CG-CAHPS asks patients to report on their experiences with a provider's officeboth the health care provider they see and the office staffover the last 12 months. This reference period of 12 months prompts respondents to consider multiple experiences with care when answering the questions. It is also consistent with the 12-month reference period for the commercial version of the Health Plan Survey.

NQMC-8611	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult inpatients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always") their pain was controlled.   The "Pain Management" composite measure is based on two questions on the CAHPS Hospital Survey that ask patients:        During this hospital stay, how often was your pain well controlled?       During this hospital stay, how often did the hospital staff do everything they could to help you with your pain?     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey is part of a larger Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) program sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). CAHPS was initiated by AHRQ in 1995 to establish survey and reporting products that provide consumers with information on health plan and provider performance. Since 1995, the initiative has grown to include a range of health care services at multiple levels of the delivery system. HCAHPS was developed by AHRQ in response to the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services' (CMS) request for a survey that supports the assessment of patients' perspectives on hospital care.   The purpose of HCAHPS is to uniformly measure and publicly report patients' perspectives on their inpatient care. While many hospitals collected information on patients' satisfaction with care, there was no national standard for collecting this information that would yield valid comparisons across all hospitals. HCAHPS represents the first national standard for the collection of information on patients' perspectives about their inpatient care.  Three broad goals have shaped the HCAHPS survey. First, the survey is designed to produce comparable data on patients' perspectives of care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between hospitals on domains that are important to consumers. Second, public reporting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care. Third, public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of hospital care provided in return for the public investment. With these goals in mind, the HCAHPS project has taken substantial steps to assure that the survey is credible, useful, and practical. This methodology and the information it generates is made available to the public.

NQMC-5616	This measure is used to assess the satisfaction with care of family members of patients in the intensive care unit based upon their responses to the "Satisfaction with Care" scale on the Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit (FS-ICU 24) questionnaire. In the intensive care unit (ICU), patient-centered care includes family-centered care. Since most ICU patients cannot make decisions for themselves, families are often involved as surrogate decision makers. Therefore the perspectives of family and other surrogate decision makers are especially important in the critical care setting, and family satisfaction is an important outcome measure.  Families have an important role in sharing relevant information, for example: what transpired before the admission; what kind of person the patient is; and, perhaps most importantly, what the patient would want in terms of care, given the current situation.   A key domain of quality of care is satisfaction with care. Because desirable health status outcomes may not be attained after critical illness and because mortality rates in tertiary referral ICUs may approach 15% to 20%, satisfaction with care is important not only to patients but also to their families. Furthermore, given that the majority of critically ill patients (especially those at high risk for poor outcomes) are unable to participate in decision making about treatments, the familys perspective is central to understanding (and measuring) satisfaction with care in the ICU. Respondents' answers to the "Satisfaction with Care" items on the Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit (FS-ICU 24) questionnaire (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Family members of intensive care unit patients who completed the Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit (FS-ICU 24) questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-9069	The CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Adult Version provides information on the experiences of commercial and Medicaid members with the health plan and gives a general indication of how well the health plan meets members' expectations. Results summarize member satisfaction through ratings, composites and question summary rates.  Four global rating questions reflect overall satisfaction.        Rating of All Health Care       Rating of Personal Doctor       Rating of Specialist Seen Most Often       Rating of Health Plan     For this "Rating of Specialist Seen Most Often" measure, members rate the specialist they saw most often on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the "worst specialist possible" and 10 is the "best specialist possible".The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. Survey results give health plans the opportunity for continuous improvement in member care. Member's ratings of the specialist they saw most often on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the "worst specialist possible" and 10 is the "best specialist possible" (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Eligible health plan members 18 years and older who answered the "Rating of Specialist Seen Most Often" question on the CAHPS 5.0H Adult Questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-7461	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their providers communicated well.   This "How Well Providers Communicate with Patients" composite measure is based on six questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult 12-Month Survey that asks how often:        Provider explained things in a way that was easy to understand       Provider listened carefully to patient       Provider gave easy to understand information about health questions or concerns       Provider knew important information about patient's medical history       Provider showed respect for what patient had to say       Provider spent enough time with patient     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The 12-month version of the CG-CAHPS asks patients to report on their experiences with a provider's officeboth the health care provider they see and the office staffover the last 12 months. This reference period of 12 months prompts respondents to consider multiple experiences with care when answering the questions. It is also consistent with the 12-month reference period for the commercial version of the Health Plan Survey. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" responses on the "How Well Providers Communicate with Patients" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "How Well Providers Communicate with Patients" questions on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult 12-Month Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-5232	This measure is used to assess adult dental plan patients' perceptions of their regular dentist. Patients rate their dentists on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst regular dentist possible and 10 is the best regular dentist possible.   Note: Typically, the percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.Patient satisfaction is a common subject in the dental literature, and this partly seems to result from the unique nature of dental care.  Patients tend to suffer from a fair amount of anxiety related to dental care - most notably with respect to the pain and discomfort associated (at least subjectively) with many dental procedures. One survey in Kentucky found that 40% of the population reported dental fear, with 17% reporting high dental fear.  In that same study, 52% of the population were of the opinion that "pain" was the main reason that people were afraid of the dentist.    The literature also shows that the level of distress, anxiety, or fear appear to influence patients' evaluations of dentists' behaviors and patients' satisfaction with care.  Level of anxiety has even been shown to influence the kind of communication style preferred by the patient.    Pain itself is an important dimension of the dental patient experience, and it has been shown to influence care-seeking and compliance with treatment, increase feelings of helplessness, and predict patterns of health service utilization; patients' descriptions of pain can influence clinical judgments and treatment decisions (e.g., how much pain relief is offered to the patient).  Patients view pain as a "discrete assessable component" of dental treatment.    Communication has been shown to be a significant influence on patient satisfaction.  Several studies emphasize the importance of dentist-patient interaction during the dental encounter - especially in terms of what has been labeled "communicative involvement" in one study.  Communicatively involved dentists appear attentive, perceptive, and responsive to patients' comments and needs; they establish rapport, discuss treatment plans and options, and help elaborate and confirm the patient's understanding of their treatment encounter.   This kind of open, interactive communication has been shown to improve the patient's overall satisfaction with their dental provider.    In addition, it has been generally shown that a dentist's "chairside manner" significantly influences dental care outcomes such as patients' satisfaction, anxiety, and willingness to return for further treatment.  Patients who receive incomplete, general, or impersonal information regarding their condition of treatment tend to perceive their dentist as hostile.  This desire for information reflects the desire patients have to play a collaborative role in decision-making regarding their dental care, although many perceive that they play a passive role in treatment decisions.  In some cases, however, some patients (e.g., those who suffer from particularly high anxiety) do show a preference for interaction marked by "communicative dominance" on the practitioner's part, which refers to the extent to which the dentist controls the nature and topics of the encounter.    Another dimension is satisfaction with the results of dental treatment.  This dimension is to some extent concentrated in the specialty area of prosthodontics - the sub-field that deals with the restoration and replacement of teeth (e.g., fitting of dentures, implants, and bridges) - although these satisfaction concerns do span other areas of dentistry.  This dimension includes basic (improvement in) comfort experienced by the patient as a result of dental work, the functionality of prosthodontic dental work (e.g., in eating or chewing, or phonetics), as well as the overall appearance, or aesthetics, of prosthodontics.   Patients' ratings of their dentists on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst regular dentist possible and 10 is the best regular dentist possible.    Note: Higher ratings indicate better quality.   Dental plan patients age 18 years and older who answered the "Overall Ratings - Regular Dentist" question on the CAHPS Dental Plan Survey
NQMC-9070	The CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Adult Version provides information on the experiences of commercial and Medicaid members with the health plan and gives a general indication of how well the health plan meets members' expectations. Results summarize member satisfaction through ratings, composites and question summary rates.  Seven composite scores summarize responses in key areas.        Claims Processing (commercial only)       Customer Service       Getting Care Quickly       Getting Needed Care       How Well Doctors Communicate       Shared Decision Making       Plan Information on Costs (commercial only)     For this "Claims Processing" measure, members indicate how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always," or "Don't know") their health plan handled their claims quickly and correctly. The "Claims Processing" composite measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS 5.0H Adult Questionnaire.The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome.

NQMC-3048	This measure is used to assess adult in-center hemodialysis patients' perceptions of their kidney doctor. Patients rate their kidney doctor on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst kidney doctor possible and 10 is the best kidney doctor possible. Responses are grouped by rating: percentages are reported for either ratings of 9 and 10, 7 and 8, and 6 and lower OR ratings of 10, 8 and 9, and 7 and lower.  Note: The percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 (or sometimes 10) is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower OR 10, 8 and 9, and 7 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.As a result of legislation passed in 1972, Medicare pays for more than two-thirds of the expenditures for care for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To help ensure that these patients are receiving quality care, the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) has been reporting comparative clinical information at the facility level since January of 2001 on its Dialysis Facility Compare Web site. However, patient survey results are noticeably absent from the current set of quality measures for ESRD care. In recent years, both the U.S. Office of the Inspector General and MedPac's 2003 Report to Congress noted the need to evaluate the experience of care for ESRD patients.  Consequently, in late 2002, CMS requested that the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the CAHPS grantees produce a patient survey for in-center hemodialysis patients.  This request was part of CMS's broader quality agenda for its ESRD program.    The CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey is designed to assess the experiences of hemodialysis patients who receive care from dialysis facilities. It is intended to serve as a tool that both facilities and End-Stage Renal Disease Networks can use to measure and improve the patient-centeredness of their care. In-center hemodialysis patients' ratings of their kidney doctor on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst kidney doctor possible and 10 is the best kidney doctor possible (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) In-center hemodialysis patients, age 18 years and older, who answered the "Rating of Kidney Doctors" question on the CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-6444	This measure is used to assess the percentage of surgical patients who indicated whether ("Yes, definitely", "Yes, somewhat", or "No") their surgeon's office staff was helpful, courteous, and respectful.  The "Helpful, Courteous, and Respectful Staff at Surgeon's Office" composite measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey that asks patients whether clerks and receptionists at the surgeon's office:        Were as helpful as they thought they should be       Treated them with courtesy and respect     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Surgical Care Survey addresses the need to assess and improve the experiences of surgical patients. Like other CAHPS surveys, this questionnaire focuses on aspects of surgical quality that are important to patients and for which patients are the best source of information. The survey results are expected to be useful to everyone with a need for information on the quality of surgeons and surgical care, including patients, practice groups, health plans, insurers, and specialty boards.  The Surgical Care Survey expands on the current CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey, which focuses on primary and specialty care, by incorporating domains that are relevant to surgical care, such as informed consent, anesthesia care, and post-operative follow-up. The survey is unique among CAHPS surveys in that it assesses patients' experiences with surgical care in both the inpatient and outpatient settings by asking respondents about their care before, during, and after surgery.  The number of respondents from the denominator who indicated "Yes, definitely", "Yes, somewhat", or "No" responses on the "Helpful, Courteous, and Respectful Staff at Surgeon's Office" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients age 18 years and older who had a surgery performed during the reporting period and who answered the "Helpful, Courteous, and Respectful Staff at Surgeon's Office" questions on the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-2104	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive women who reported how often they found it hard to talk to their women's health providers.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Women's Health Care Module. Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction     Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall. The number of patients who indicated "All of the time," "Most times," "Sometimes," "Rarely," "Never," or "Does not apply" to the item, "I found it hard to talk to my women's health providers."

NQMC-844	This composite measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who indicated ("Yes" or "No") whether they were provided information about treatment options. The "Information About Treatment Options" composite measure is based on two questions on the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey.    Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.  Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.  The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies. This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:        To satisfy external standards.       To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.       To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.       To hold providers accountable through public reporting.    The number of health plan members from the denominator who indicated "Yes" or "No" on the two questions regarding whether they received information about treatment options Health plan members age 18 years and older, enrolled in a managed care organization (MCO) or managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) for the previous 12 months with no more than one break in enrollment of up to 45 days during the enrollment period, who received behavioral health care services and who answered the "Information About Treatment Options" questions on the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey
NQMC-9090	The CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Child Version provides information on parents' or guardians' experience with their child's health plan for the population of children with chronic conditions (CCC). Results include the same ratings, composites and individual question summary rates as those reported for the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Child Version.  In addition, three CCC composites summarize satisfaction with basic components of care essential for successful treatment, management and support of children with chronic conditions.        Access to Specialized Services       Family Centered Care: Personal Doctor Who Knows Child       Coordination of Care for Children with Chronic Conditions     Item-specific question summary rates are reported for each composite question. Question summary rates are also reported individually for two items summarizing the following concepts:        Access to Prescription Medicines       Family Centered Care: Getting Needed Information     For this "Access to Specialized Services" measure, parents or guardians of children with chronic conditions report how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") it was easy to get specialized care for their child. The "Access to Specialized Services" composite measure is based on three questions in the CAHPS 5.0H Child Questionnaire.The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome.

NQMC-3046	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who indicated how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") the dialysis center staff:        listened carefully to them.       explained things in a way that was easy to understand.       showed respect for what they had to say.       spent enough time with them.       really cared about them as a person.       made them as comfortable as possible during dialysis.       inserted their needles with as little pain as possible.       checked them as closely as they wanted while they were on the dialysis machine.       were able to manage problems during their dialysis.       behaved in a professional manner.       explained blood test results in a way that was easy to understand.     AND  The percentage of respondents who indicated how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always"):        they were put on the dialysis machine within 15 minutes of their appointment or shift time.       the dialysis center was as clean as it could be.       they were satisfied with the way the dialysis facility staff handled problems.     AND  The percentage of respondents who indicated whether ("Yes" or "No"):        the dialysis center staff kept information about them and their health as private as possible from other patients.       they felt comfortable asking dialysis center staff everything they wanted about dialysis care.       the dialysis center staff talked about to them about what they should eat and drink.     The "Quality of Dialysis Center Care and Operations" composite measure is based on seventeen questions in the CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey.

NQMC-3901	This measure is used to assess the mean score for the questions in the "Overall Ratings" section of the Home Health Care Survey.    The "Overall Ratings" section is one of five sections that comprise the Home Health Care Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Healthcare employee satisfaction and retention           Healthcare facility competitive market strength           Hospital profitability           Risk management (likelihood of being sued)                The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Overall Ratings" section of the Home Health Care Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Home Health Care Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details. Patients receiving home health care during the reporting period who answered at least one question in the "Overall Ratings" section of the Home Health Care Survey.  Deceased patients are excluded from sampling.
NQMC-2976	This measure is used to assess the proportion of children whose parents reported care received was helpful or very helpful in specific areas of parenting such as understanding child's behavior, protecting child from injuries, and helping the parent learn to meet their own needs.  The parent is questioned as to whether the care provided was helpful, very helpful, somewhat helpful, not helpful, or item was not discussed.Significant opportunities for improvement exist in ensuring that young children and families receive recommended preventive and developmental health care services.  A growing body of literature supports the delivery of parental anticipatory guidance, assessment follow-up on the development of children, and assessment of the psychosocial well-being of families.    Few standardized quality measures are available that provide specific information about preventive health care for young children, especially on aspects of care for which parents and families are a reliable source of information about the quality of their child's health care.  A majority of the measures currently used provide information about whether children come in for well-child visits (access to care measures) or are based on medical chart reviews which are not accurate for the specific level of information obtained in the Promoting Healthy Development Survey (PHDS). Children whose parents responded "Very Helpful" and "Helpful" to all of the items in the "Helpfulness of Care Provided" scale (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Children age 3 months to 48 months who received a well-child visit in the last 12 months, whose parent received the aspect of care*, and whose parent answered at least half of the items in the "Helpfulness of Care Provided" scale on the Promoting Healthy Development Survey (PHDS)     *See the "Description" field.
NQMC-8613	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult inpatients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always") their room and bathroom were kept clean.  The "Cleanliness of Hospital Environment" measure is based on one question on the CAHPS Hospital Survey.The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey is part of a larger Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) program sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). CAHPS was initiated by AHRQ in 1995 to establish survey and reporting products that provide consumers with information on health plan and provider performance. Since 1995, the initiative has grown to include a range of health care services at multiple levels of the delivery system. HCAHPS was developed by AHRQ in response to the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services' (CMS) request for a survey that supports the assessment of patients' perspectives on hospital care.   The purpose of HCAHPS is to uniformly measure and publicly report patients' perspectives on their inpatient care. While many hospitals collected information on patients' satisfaction with care, there was no national standard for collecting this information that would yield valid comparisons across all hospitals. HCAHPS represents the first national standard for the collection of information on patients' perspectives about their inpatient care.  Three broad goals have shaped the HCAHPS survey. First, the survey is designed to produce comparable data on patients' perspectives of care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between hospitals on domains that are important to consumers. Second, public reporting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care. Third, public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of hospital care provided in return for the public investment. With these goals in mind, the HCAHPS project has taken substantial steps to assure that the survey is credible, useful, and practical. This methodology and the information it generates is made available to the public. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always" responses on the "Cleanliness of Hospital Environment" question (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Hospital inpatients with an admission during the reporting period who answered the "Cleanliness of Hospital Environment" question on the CAHPS Hospital Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-7399	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who reported how often their family member's nursing home provided appropriate staffing, care of belongings, and cleanliness.   This "Nursing Home Staffing, Care of Belongings, and Cleanliness" composite measure is based on seven questions in the CAHPS Nursing Home Family Member Survey. Five questions ask respondents (defined as family members of nursing home residents) how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always"):        Can find a nurse or aide       Enough nurses/aides       Room looks/smells clean       Resident looks/ smells clean       Public areas look/smell clean     AND  One question asks respondents how often ("Never," "Once," "2+ times"):        Family member's personal medical belongings lost     AND  One question asks respondents how often ("Never," "Once or twice," "3+ times"):        Family member's clothes damaged or lost     The Family Member Survey asks respondents to report on their own experiences (not the resident's) with the nursing home and their perceptions of the quality of care provided to a family member living in a nursing home. This instrument is designed to be administered by mail.  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level (nursing home) reporting.The CAHPS Nursing Home Surveys include three instruments designed to provide information on the experiences of nursing home residents and their family members. Multiple versions of the Nursing Home Surveys are available to meet different needs:        Long-Stay Resident Survey       Discharged Resident       Family Member Survey     The Nursing Home Surveys can be used in monitoring programs designed to improve both care quality and patient satisfaction.  Although the family members do not receive care from the nursing home, their experiences at the nursing home and with staff are important in describing the quality of the nursing home. Family members often help choose the nursing home and continue to be involved with their family member after entry, participating in care planning and making decisions on behalf of the resident. Like the CAHPS Nursing Home Resident Surveys, the family reported experiences of care complement other, publicly reported data such as health deficiencies, staffing, and other quality indicators (e.g., percent of residents with restraints), and thus contribute to providing a comprehensive view of quality care.  The Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services requested development of this questionnaire to complement the Long-Stay Resident Instrument especially for those residents who may be too impaired to respond for themselves. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" and "Once," "Once or Twice," "2+ times," "3+ times" responses on the "Nursing Home Staffing, Care of Belongings, and Cleanliness" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All respondents (defined as family members of nursing home residents) who answered the "Nursing Home Staffing, Care of Belongings, and Cleanliness" questions on the CAHPS Nursing Home Family Member Survey
NQMC-229	This measure assesses the mean score on six items asking about the helpfulness of counseling among young adults who received counseling on cigarettes, alcohol, condoms/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and birth control.Health behaviors, such as alcohol use and drunk driving, sexual activity, depression, suicide, smoking, violence, and guns are the primary causes of morbidity and mortality among adolescents. Preventive counseling and screening on these and other health risk topics are the centerpiece of adolescent preventive services guidelines. Common components in adolescent preventive services guidelines set forth by the American Medical Association (AMA), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the U.S. Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) include:       Periodic adolescent health care visits specifically     focused on preventive screening and counseling.       Private and confidential care whereby adolescents can     meet privately with providers with assurances of confidentiality.       Education and counseling on behavioral, emotional, and     medical risks to health. This includes encouraging good health habits (e.g.,     healthy eating, physical activity) and providing guidance on avoiding risky     behaviors (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, unprotected sexual activity, drunk     driving, ignoring or reacting inappropriately to negative emotions, use of     drugs, violence, and guns).       Screening, early identification and referrals for behavioral, emotional, and medical risks. This includes screening for smoking, alcohol, sexual activity, depression, street drug use, involvement in or victim of violence or abuse, access to and use of guns, and unsafe practices such as infrequent helmet and seatbelt use or driving in a care with a driver who has been drinking alcohol.    Studies demonstrate that adolescents trust health care providers. Adolescents are interested and willing to talk with providers about recommended preventive counseling and screening topics, especially during private, confidential health care visits. Yet, for many reasons, including young adult access barriers to care and provider training and incentives, few adolescents receive recommended comprehensive preventive counseling and screening services on key topics such as alcohol use, depression, sexual activity, smoking, injury prevention, physical activity, and diet.    Among other strategies, performance measurement can be a powerful component of efforts to improve preventive services for adolescents. Experts and consumers emphasize the importance of adolescent preventive care as a top priority for health care system accountability and performance reporting, and point to the current lack of measurement methods. While the rate at which adolescents have yearly well-visits is being used by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) as a national indicator of quality for health maintenance organizations, this measure provides no information about the provision of preventive counseling and screening nor takes into account the fact that preventive services are often provided outside the context of well-visits.    The Young Adult Health Care Survey (YAHCS) was developed to complement existing performance measurement methods. This 45-item survey was designed to provide a parsimonious, comprehensive and actionable assessment of adherence to adolescent preventive counseling and screening guidelines. If they got counseling, mean score on six items asking about the helpfulness of counseling on selected topics: cigarettes, alcohol, condoms/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), birth control The number of young adults age 14 years or older who answered "yes" to at least one of the six related provision of counseling items and therefore were asked at least one of the helpfulness of care questions
NQMC-4532	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who indicated how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") it was easy for them to:        Get appointments with specialists       Get the care, tests, or treatment they needed through their health plan     The "Getting Needed Care" composite measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 4.0 (Adult Questionnaire).  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care. The CAHPS consortium began by developing the CAHPS Health Plan Survey, an integrated set of carefully tested and standardized questionnaires and report formats that can be used to produce meaningful, reliable, and comparable information about the experiences of consumers enrolled in health plans.  The CAHPS Health Plan Survey is designed to generate information that consumers can use to choose health plans, that purchasers can use to assess the value of services they buy, and that health plans can use to assess their performance and improve their products and services. As AHRQ had intended, the survey can be used with all types of health insurance consumers--including Medicaid recipients, Medicare beneficiaries, and those who are commercially insured--and across the full range of health care delivery systems, from fee-for-service to managed care plans. The instruments also capture information about special groups, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities and families with children.  The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires health plans to submit measures from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey as part of their HEDIS submission and for accreditation purposes. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always" responses on the "Getting Needed Care" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Health plan members age 18 years and older who answered the "Getting Needed Care" questions on the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 4.0 (Adult Questionnaire) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-9317	The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Adult Version provides information on patients' experience with practices and gives a general indication of how well a practice meets patient expectations. Results summarize patient experience with care through an overall rating question, composites and question summary rates.   For this measure, adult patients reported how many days ("Same day," "1 day," "2 to 3 days," "4 to 7 days," or "More than 7 days") they usually had to wait for an appointment when they needed care right away. This measure is based on the following one question in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Adult Version:        Q7: In the last 12 months, how many days did you usually have to wait for an appointment when you needed care right away?   The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. The number of "Same day," "1 day," "2 to 3 days," "4 to 7 days," and "More than 7 days" responses on the question, "In the last 12 months, how many days did you usually have to wait for an appointment when you needed care right away?" (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Eligible patients who answered the question, "In the last 12 months, how many days did you usually have to wait for an appointment when you needed care right away?," on the CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Adult Version (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-2022	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adolescent and adult patients who reported how often they found their providers to be accepting and non-judgmental of their life and health care choices.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Core Measures.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction    Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall. The number of patients who indicated "All of the time," "Most times," "Sometimes," "Rarely," "Never," or "Does not apply" to the item, "I found my providers to be accepting and non-judgmental of my life and health care choices."

NQMC-7261	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the "Relationship with the Doctors" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Bereavement Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on the caregivers' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following questions:        How satisfied are you that you knew the doctor(s) in charge of your relative's care in the last month of life?       How satisfied are you that the doctor(s) took a personal interest in your relative in the last month of life?       How satisfied are you that the doctor(s) were available when you or your relative needed them (by phone or in person) in the last month of life?       How satisfied are you with the level of trust and confidence you had in the doctor(s) who looked after your relative in the last month of life?     Note: The "Relationship with the Doctors" domain is one of six domains comprising the CANHELP Bereavement Questionnaire. Mean scale scores are calculated for each domain of the questionnaire. In addition, an "Overall" satisfaction score is calculated. Please note that there is another version of the surveyCANHELP Liteavailable from the CARENET Web site.Initiatives to improve satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care remain hampered by a nascent understanding of what quality care means to patients and their families, and how it is best measured. Several experts and professional societies have attempted to define the specific components and related areas (domains) involved in quality EOL care; in contrast, patient and family perspectives are surprisingly lacking.   Most previous studies of quality have focused on outpatients and people with cancer. Researchers recently documented that most Canadians (greater than 70%) die in hospitals, and the majority of decedents are elderly patients who died from causes unrelated to cancer. The trajectory of a patient dying from cancer differs from one dying from other, chronic, end-stage medical conditions. Thus, issues deemed important to quality EOL care that were identified by previous investigators may not be generalizable to seriously ill patients with advanced disease other than cancer, who have a more uncertain prognosis.   Although a "quality death" is an espoused right of Canadians, for many dying patients and their families it is not achieved. Recent reviews and observational studies describe considerable dissatisfaction with EOL care, indicating that there are still opportunities for improvement. Ideally, initiatives aimed at improving EOL care would be informed by the experiences and expectations of patients and their family members. However, such efforts are often hampered by inadequate definitions of quality of care and by suboptimal tools for measurement.   In a recent review, few studies evaluated satisfaction with care at the EOL, and most used non-validated assessment tools. To advance this field, standardized, validated satisfaction questionnaires are needed to measure meaningful outcomes in order to evaluate the effects of various clinical, organizational, policy, and financial initiatives that influence how EOL care is delivered and experienced. By first understanding patients' and families' levels of satisfaction with key elements of EOL care, we will be in a better position to improve their individual care, and to introduce quality improvement initiatives to the health care system as needed.   The Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire was designed to help researchers, health care providers, patients, and their families better understand satisfaction with care provided to seriously ill patients with advanced disease and to identify opportunities for improvement. Caregivers' ratings on the "Relationship with the Doctors" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Bereavement Questionnaire (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of questions answered by caregivers who completed the "Relationship with the Doctors" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Bereavement Questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-7468	This measure is used to assess the adult patients' overall rating of their provider. The survey asked patients to rate their provider on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being the worst and 10 being the best.  The Visit Survey is meant to capture information about a patient's most recent visit.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Visit Survey asks patients to report on their experiences with providers and office staff at their most recent visit to a provider's office. This instrument addresses feedback from many users regarding the need for a CAHPS survey that focuses on experiences during a single visit rather than over a period of time. More targeted feedback about a visit can provide medical practices with valuable information for monitoring and improvement. Also, many physicians are accustomed to seeing survey results for a visit, which they sometimes perceive as more valid and credible. Patients' rating of their provider on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 being the worst and 10 being the best (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "Patients' Rating of the Provider" question on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult Visit Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

The 12-month version of the CG-CAHPS asks patients to report on their experiences with a provider's officeboth the health care provider they see and the office staffover the last 12 months. This reference period of 12 months prompts respondents to consider multiple experiences with care when answering the questions. It is also consistent with the 12-month reference period for the commercial version of the Health Plan Survey.

NQMC-7248	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the "Decision Making" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Patient Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on patients' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following questions:        How satisfied are you with discussions during the past month with your doctor(s) about where you would be cared for (in hospital, at home, or elsewhere) if you were to get worse?       How satisfied are you with discussions during the past month with your doctor(s) about the use of life sustaining technologies (for example: CPR or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, breathing machines, dialysis)?       How satisfied are you that, during the past month, you have come to understand what to expect in the end stage of your illness (for example: in terms of symptoms and comfort measures)?       How satisfied are you with your role during the past month in decision making regarding your medical care?     Note: The "Decision Making" domain is one of six domains comprising the CANHELP Patient Questionnaire. Mean scale scores are calculated for each domain of the questionnaire. In addition, an "Overall" satisfaction score is calculated.

NQMC-7469	This individual item measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") their provider's office followed up with them about results of a blood test, x-ray, or other test.  This "Individual Item: Follow up on Test Results" measure is based on one question in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys Adult Visit Survey that asks whether:        Someone from provider's office followed up with patient to give results of blood test, x-ray, or other test     The Visit Survey is meant to capture information about a patient's most recent visit. However, only questions about provider communication and office staff ask about the most recent visit. Questions about access to care use a 12-month reference period.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Visit Survey asks patients to report on their experiences with providers and office staff at their most recent visit to a provider's office. This instrument addresses feedback from many users regarding the need for a CAHPS survey that focuses on experiences during a single visit rather than over a period of time. More targeted feedback about a visit can provide medical practices with valuable information for monitoring and improvement. Also, many physicians are accustomed to seeing survey results for a visit, which they sometimes perceive as more valid and credible.

NQMC-8636	The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Child Version provides information on parents' experience with their child's practice. Results summarize patient experiences through an overall rating question, composites and individual question summary rates.  For this measure, parents or guardians reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their child's provider explained things in a way that was easy for their child to understand. This measure is based on the following one question in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Child Version:        Q8: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider explain things in a way that was easy for your child to understand?   The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," and "Always" responses on the question, "In the last 12 months, how often did this provider explain things in a way that was easy for your child to understand?"

NQMC-2014	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adolescent and adult patients who reported how often their visits with their providers got interrupted (by phone calls, other patients, etc.).    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Core Measures. Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction    Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall. The number of patients who indicated "All of the time," "Most times," "Sometimes," "Rarely," "Never," or "Does not apply" to the item, "When I saw my providers, my visits got interrupted (by phone calls, other patients, etc.)."

NQMC-9071	The CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Adult Version provides information on the experiences of commercial and Medicaid members with the health plan and gives a general indication of how well the health plan meets members' expectations. Results summarize member satisfaction through ratings, composites and question summary rates.  Seven composite scores summarize responses in key areas.        Claims Processing (commercial only)       Customer Service       Getting Care Quickly       Getting Needed Care       How Well Doctors Communicate       Shared Decision Making       Plan Information on Costs (commercial only)     For this "Customer Service" measure, members indicate how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their health plan's customer service gave them needed information or help and treated them with courtesy and respect. The "Customer Service" composite measure is based two questions in the CAHPS 5.0H Adult Questionnaire.The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. Survey results give health plans the opportunity for continuous improvement in member care. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," and "Always" responses on the "Customer Service" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Eligible health plan members 18 years and older who answered the "Customer Service" questions on the CAHPS 5.0H Adult Questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-4550	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who reported their experiences with their children's personal doctor or nurse for their children with chronic conditions*.    The "Parents' Experience with the Child's Personal Doctor or Nurse" composite measure is based on three questions on the CAHPS 4.0 Health Plan Survey (Child Questionnaire).    Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.    *Children with special health care needs are those who have a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that generally required by children.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care. The CAHPS consortium began by developing the CAHPS Health Plan Survey, an integrated set of carefully tested and standardized questionnaires and report formats that can be used to produce meaningful, reliable, and comparable information about the experiences of consumers enrolled in health plans.  The CAHPS Health Plan Survey is designed to generate information that consumers can use to choose health plans, that purchasers can use to assess the value of services they buy, and that health plans can use to assess their performance and improve their products and services. As AHRQ had intended, the survey can be used with all types of health insurance consumers--including Medicaid recipients, Medicare beneficiaries, and those who are commercially insured--and across the full range of health care delivery systems, from fee-for-service to managed care plans. The instruments also capture information about special groups, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities and families with children.  The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires health plans to submit measures from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey as part of their HEDIS submission and for accreditation purposes.  Research indicates that children with chronic conditions account for 15 to 18 percent of all children under 18, although some sponsors of the CAHPS Health Plan Survey may serve a relatively higher proportion of children with chronic conditions than is found in the general population.  While the numbers of children with chronic conditions may be small, several factors point to the need to measure and report on quality of care for this segment of the population:        Financial impact. Children with chronic conditions consume a preponderance of the health care dollars spent on children, with estimates ranging from 80 to 90 percent.       Evidence of poor quality. Researchers have found that quality of care for children with chronic conditions is often inadequate. According to studies conducted by FACCT-The Foundation for Accountability, parents of children with chronic conditions rate their experiences with care at a level that ranges from 50 percent to 80 percent of what would be considered optimal.      It is critical to assess and track quality of care for this vulnerable segment so that parents, health plans, and other survey sponsors can evaluate how well the needs of children with chronic conditions are being met and identify which aspects of care need to be improved.            Equity. The experiences that children with chronic conditions have with health plans and providers are often different from those of healthy children, who primarily rely on the health care system for preventive and acute care. Families, health plans, and policymakers need to know if quality of care is not consistent for all children and which plans are best suited to meet the needs of children with chronic conditions.       The need for relevant information. The continual needs of children with chronic conditions far exceed those of their peers, particularly with respect to the type, scope, and frequency of health care services they require. They also have a greater demand for health information, education, partnership with providers, and coordination of care. When reviewing their coverage options, the parents of these children need access to comparative performance information that is relevant to their circumstances.    The number of health plan members from the denominator whose parents indicated "Yes" or "No" to the "Parents' Experience with the Child's Personal Doctor or Nurse" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Health plan members age 17 years and younger with chronic conditions (as determined by specific screening criteria included in the questionnaire) whose parents or guardians answered the "Parents' Experience with the Child's Personal Doctor or Nurse" questions on the CAHPS 4.0 Health Plan Survey (Child Questionnaire) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-2247	This measure is used to assess the mean score for the questions in the "Personal Issues" section of the Inpatient Pediatric Survey.    The "Personal Issues" section is one of ten sections that comprise the Inpatient Pediatric Survey.  Mean section scores are reported for each section of this survey.  In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).      Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction           Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)                The mean of all the parents' scores for the questions from the "Personal Issues" section of the Inpatient Pediatric Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Inpatient Pediatric Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details.

NQMC-7490	This measure is used to assess the percentage of parents/guardians who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") their child's provider supported them in taking care of their child's health.  This "Providers Support You in Taking Care of Your Own Health" composite measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child 12-Month Survey with Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Items that ask whether:        In the last 12 months, did anyone in this provider's office talk with you about specific goals for your child's health?       In the last 12 months, did anyone in this provider's office ask you if there are things that make it hard for you to take care of your child's health?     This survey combines the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey with the PCMH Item Set to address the domains of the medical home.  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     To address interest in assessing patient experience with the patient-centered medical home model, the CAHPS Consortium has developed an extended version of the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey that incorporates the CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Item Set. The item set expands on existing CG-CAHPS survey domains and adds questions in other domains to address key elements of the medical home model.  The PCMH is a model for delivering primary care that is patient-centered, comprehensive, coordinated, accessible, and continuously improved through a systems-based approach to quality and safety.  Primary care practices throughout the U.S. are implementing the medical home model. To evaluate the impact of implementing this model, health care organizations and public agencies are investigating how it affects the effectiveness, efficiency, and patient-centeredness of care. The number of "Yes" or "No" responses on the "Providers Support You in Taking Care of Your Own Health" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All parents/guardians who answered the "Providers Support You in Taking Care of Your Own Health" questions on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child 12-Month Survey with Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Items (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-8958	This measure is used to assess the patients' overall rating of their interpreter. The survey asked patients to rate their interpreter on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst interpreter possible and 10 is the best interpreter possible.  The Cultural Competence Item Set consists of supplemental items designed for use with the CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Cultural Competence Item Set was developed to improve the ability of the CG-CAHPS to assess the cultural competence of providers; the item set expands on existing survey domains and adds questions in other domains of cultural competency that were not adequately addressed in the existing surveys.  This item set is intended to generate data that health care providers can use to improve their cultural competence by:        Identifying specific topic areas for quality improvement.       Recognizing particular behaviors that inhibit effective communication.       Measuring the effect of behaviors that promote effective communication.     The evidence of significant racial and ethnic disparities in access to health care, outcomes, and health status among racial and ethnic minorities is well documented. Among the strategies that have been advocated for reducing racial and ethnic differences in patient experiences with care is the provision of "culturally competent" medical care. Culturally competent care is defined as care that is responsive to diversity in the patient population and cultural factors that can affect health and health care, such as language, communication styles, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. To be culturally competent, health care providers have to employ various interpersonal and organizational strategies that bridge barriers to communication and understanding that stem from racial, ethnic, cultural, and linguistic differences. Patients' overall rating of their interpreter on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst interpreter possible and 10 is the best interpreter possible (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "Patients' Rating of the Interpreter" question from the Cultural Competence Item Set on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-7250	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the "Your Well Being" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Patient Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on patients' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following questions:         How satisfied are you with the level of confidence you felt during the past month in your own ability to manage your illness?       How satisfied are you that you were able during the past month to contribute to others in a meaningful way?       How satisfied are you that you did special things you wanted to do during the past month (for example: resolve conflicts, complete projects, participate in special family events, travel)?       How satisfied are you that you were at peace during the past month?     Note: The "Your Well Being" domain is one of six domains comprising the CANHELP Patient Questionnaire. Mean scale scores are calculated for each domain of the questionnaire. In addition, an "Overall" satisfaction score is calculated. Please note that there is another version of the surveyCANHELP Liteavailable from the CARENET Web site.Initiatives to improve satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care remain hampered by a nascent understanding of what quality care means to patients and their families, and how it is best measured. Several experts and professional societies have attempted to define the specific components and related areas (domains) involved in quality EOL care; in contrast, patient and family perspectives are surprisingly lacking.   Most previous studies of quality have focused on outpatients and people with cancer. Researchers recently documented that most Canadians (greater than 70%) die in hospitals, and the majority of decedents are elderly patients who died from causes unrelated to cancer. The trajectory of a patient dying from cancer differs from one dying from other, chronic, end-stage medical conditions. Thus, issues deemed important to quality EOL care that were identified by previous investigators may not be generalizable to seriously ill patients with advanced disease other than cancer, who have a more uncertain prognosis.   Although a "quality death" is an espoused right of Canadians, for many dying patients and their families it is not achieved. Recent reviews and observational studies describe considerable dissatisfaction with EOL care, indicating that there are still opportunities for improvement. Ideally, initiatives aimed at improving EOL care would be informed by the experiences and expectations of patients and their family members. However, such efforts are often hampered by inadequate definitions of quality of care and by suboptimal tools for measurement.   In a recent review, few studies evaluated satisfaction with care at the EOL, and most used non-validated assessment tools. To advance this field, standardized, validated satisfaction questionnaires are needed to measure meaningful outcomes in order to evaluate the effects of various clinical, organizational, policy, and financial initiatives that influence how EOL care is delivered and experienced. By first understanding patients' and families' levels of satisfaction with key elements of EOL care, we will be in a better position to improve their individual care, and to introduce quality improvement initiatives to the health care system as needed.   The Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire was designed to help researchers, health care providers, patients, and their families better understand satisfaction with care provided to seriously ill patients with advanced disease and to identify opportunities for improvement.

NQMC-7266	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the "Your Well Being" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Bereavement Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on the caregivers' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following questions:        How satisfied are you with the level of confidence you felt in your relative's ability to manage his/her own illness in the last month of life?       How satisfied are you that in the last month of your relative's life you had enough time and energy to take care of yourself?       How satisfied are you that you had family or friends to support you when you felt lonely or isolated in the last month of your relative's life?       How satisfied are you that you were able in the last month of your relative's life to contribute to others in a meaningful way?       How satisfied are you that you and your relative did special things you wanted to do while your relative was able (for example: resolve conflicts, complete projects, participate in special family events, travel)?

Caregivers' ratings on the "Your Well Being" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Bereavement Questionnaire (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Number of questions answered by caregivers who completed the "Your Well Being" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Bereavement Questionnaire (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-6909	This measure assesses the mean score for the four questions in the "Access" section of the Medical Practice Survey.  The "Access" section is one of six sections that comprise the Medical Practice Survey. Each patient has a score for every question that was answered. For each patient, a section score is calculated as the mean of all the question scores in that particular section. Similarly, for each patient, an overall score is calculated as the mean of that patient's section scores.Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care and a component of quality care.   In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that:  "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' 'individual needs,' rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: 'Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately.' In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care... Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that '...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends' (from Press [2002], Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).   It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).  Patient satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: clinical quality (e.g., hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); chronic disease control; compliance; drug complications; quality of life; emotional health status; mental health; physical functioning; physical health status; post-surgery complications; post-surgery recovery times; risk-adjusted mortality rates; unexpected mortality; and work effectiveness (Clark, Drain,  Malone, 2004).  In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction has been linked to the following:         Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; volume; physician satisfaction; patient's trust in provider; retention; employee satisfaction.       Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in expenses; reduction in length of stay; reduction in complaints; reduction in malpractice claims; direct measures of financial performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain,  Malone, 2004).    The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Access" section of the Medical Practice Survey Patients who go for a scheduled or unscheduled doctor visit  Alternatively, visits may be with a non-physician provider such as a physician assistant (PA) or a nurse practitioner (NP). Typically, the patient has an established relationship with their care provider.  See the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field.
NQMC-8628	The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Child Version provides information on parents' experience with their child's practice. Results summarize patient experiences through an overall rating question, composites and individual question summary rates.  For this "Rating of Provider" measure, parents or guardians were asked to rate their child's provider on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the "worst provider possible" and 10 is the "best provider possible". Responses are grouped by rating. A question summary rate is calculated for response choices 0 to 10 individually, 8+9+10, and 9+10. The question summary rate indicates the proportion of patients who selected a particular response choice. The "Rating of Provider" measure is based on one question in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Child Version:        Q35: Using any number from 0 to 10, where 0 is the "worst provider possible" and 10 is the "best provider possible," what number would you use to rate this provider?   The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. Parents' or guardians' ratings of their child's provider on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the "worst provider possible" and 10 is the "best provider possible" (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Eligible patients whose parent or guardian answered the "Rating of Provider" question on the CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Child Version (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-7474	This measure indicates the percentage of patients/guardians (respondents) who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") their child's provider talked about keeping their child from getting injured, the food the child eats, physical activity, and household problems on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child 12-Month Survey.  This "Provider's Advice on Keeping Your Child Safe and Healthy" composite measure is based on five questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child 12-Month Survey that asks whether:        Respondent and provider talked about injury prevention       Provider gave information on injury prevention       Respondent and provider talked about child's eating habits       Respondent and provider talked about child's physical activity       Respondent and provider talked about any problems in the household that might affect child     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The 12-month version of the CG-CAHPS asks patients to report on their experiences with a provider's officeboth the health care provider they see and the office staffover the last 12 months. This reference period of 12 months prompts respondents to consider multiple experiences with care when answering the questions. It is also consistent with the 12-month reference period for the commercial version of the Health Plan Survey. The number of "Yes" or "No" responses on the "Provider's Advice on Keeping Your Child Safe and Healthy" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All parents/guardians who answered the "Provider's Advice on Keeping Your Child Safe and Healthy" questions on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child 12-Month Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-2030	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adolescent and adult patients who reported whether their providers or case managers asked them about their life situation (housing, their finances, etc.), and made a referral if needed.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Core Measures.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators.

NQMC-4553	This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who reported they received assistance with coordination of care for their children with chronic conditions*.    The "Parents' Experiences with Coordination of Their Child's Care" composite measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS 4.0 Health Plan Survey (Child Questionnaire).    Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.    *Children with special health care needs are those who have a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that generally required by children.  The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care. The CAHPS consortium began by developing the CAHPS Health Plan Survey, an integrated set of carefully tested and standardized questionnaires and report formats that can be used to produce meaningful, reliable, and comparable information about the experiences of consumers enrolled in health plans.  The CAHPS Health Plan Survey is designed to generate information that consumers can use to choose health plans, that purchasers can use to assess the value of services they buy, and that health plans can use to assess their performance and improve their products and services. As AHRQ had intended, the survey can be used with all types of health insurance consumers--including Medicaid recipients, Medicare beneficiaries, and those who are commercially insured--and across the full range of health care delivery systems, from fee-for-service to managed care plans. The instruments also capture information about special groups, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities and families with children.  The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires health plans to submit measures from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey as part of their HEDIS submission and for accreditation purposes.  Research indicates that children with chronic conditions account for 15 to 18 percent of all children under 18, although some sponsors of the CAHPS Health Plan Survey may serve a relatively higher proportion of children with chronic conditions than is found in the general population.  While the numbers of children with chronic conditions may be small, several factors point to the need to measure and report on quality of care for this segment of the population:        Financial impact. Children with chronic conditions consume a preponderance of the health care dollars spent on children, with estimates ranging from 80 to 90 percent.       Evidence of poor quality. Researchers have found that quality of care for children with chronic conditions is often inadequate. According to studies conducted by FACCT-The Foundation for Accountability, parents of children with chronic conditions rate their experiences with care at a level that ranges from 50 percent to 80 percent of what would be considered optimal.      It is critical to assess and track quality of care for this vulnerable segment so that parents, health plans, and other survey sponsors can evaluate how well the needs of children with chronic conditions are being met and identify which aspects of care need to be improved.            Equity. The experiences that children with chronic conditions have with health plans and providers are often different from those of healthy children, who primarily rely on the health care system for preventive and acute care. Families, health plans, and policymakers need to know if quality of care is not consistent for all children and which plans are best suited to meet the needs of children with chronic conditions.       The need for relevant information. The continual needs of children with chronic conditions far exceed those of their peers, particularly with respect to the type, scope, and frequency of health care services they require. They also have a greater demand for health information, education, partnership with providers, and coordination of care. When reviewing their coverage options, the parents of these children need access to comparative performance information that is relevant to their circumstances.    The number of health plan members from the denominator whose parents indicated "Yes" or "No" on the "Parents' Experiences with Coordination of Their Child's Care" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Health plan members age 17 years and younger with chronic conditions (as determined by specific screening criteria included in the questionnaire) whose parents or guardians answered the "Parents' Experiences with Coordination of Their Child's Care" questions on the CAHPS 4.0 Health Plan Survey (Child Questionnaire) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-9092	The CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Child Version provides information on parents' or guardians' experience with their child's health plan for the population of children with chronic conditions (CCC). Results include the same ratings, composites and individual question summary rates as those reported for the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Child Version.

NQMC-853	This single-item measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") anyone shared information regarding their counseling or treatment that should have been kept private.Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.  The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies. This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:        To satisfy external standards.       To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.       To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.       To hold providers accountable through public reporting.

NQMC-3050	This measure is used to assess adult in-center hemodialysis patients' perceptions of their dialysis center. Patients rate their dialysis center on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst dialysis center possible and 10 is the best dialysis center possible. Responses are grouped by rating: percentages are reported for either ratings of 9 and 10, 7 and 8, and 6 and lower OR ratings of 10, 8 and 9, and 7 and lower.    Note: The percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 (or sometimes 10) is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower OR 10, 8 and 9, and 7 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.As a result of legislation passed in 1972, Medicare pays for more than two-thirds of the expenditures for care for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To help ensure that these patients are receiving quality care, the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) has been reporting comparative clinical information at the facility level since January of 2001 on its Dialysis Facility Compare Web site. However, patient survey results are noticeably absent from the current set of quality measures for ESRD care. In recent years, both the U.S. Office of the Inspector General and MedPac's 2003 Report to Congress noted the need to evaluate the experience of care for ESRD patients.  Consequently, in late 2002, CMS requested that the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the CAHPS grantees produce a patient survey for in-center hemodialysis patients.  This request was part of CMS's broader quality agenda for its ESRD program.    The CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey is designed to assess the experiences of hemodialysis patients who receive care from dialysis facilities. It is intended to serve as a tool that both facilities and End-Stage Renal Disease Networks can use to measure and improve the patient-centeredness of their care. In-center hemodialysis patients' ratings of their dialysis center on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst dialysis center possible and 10 is the best dialysis center possible (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) In-center hemodialysis patients, age 18 years and older, who answered the "Rating of Dialysis Center" question on the CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-8607	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult inpatients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always") their doctors communicated well.   The "Communication with Doctors" composite measure is based on three questions on the CAHPS Hospital Survey that ask patients:         During this hospital stay, how often did doctors treat you with courtesy and respect?       During this hospital stay, how often did doctors listen carefully to you?       During this hospital stay, how often did doctors explain things in a way you could understand?     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey is part of a larger Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) program sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). CAHPS was initiated by AHRQ in 1995 to establish survey and reporting products that provide consumers with information on health plan and provider performance. Since 1995, the initiative has grown to include a range of health care services at multiple levels of the delivery system. HCAHPS was developed by AHRQ in response to the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services' (CMS) request for a survey that supports the assessment of patients' perspectives on hospital care.   The purpose of HCAHPS is to uniformly measure and publicly report patients' perspectives on their inpatient care. While many hospitals collected information on patients' satisfaction with care, there was no national standard for collecting this information that would yield valid comparisons across all hospitals. HCAHPS represents the first national standard for the collection of information on patients' perspectives about their inpatient care.  Three broad goals have shaped the HCAHPS survey. First, the survey is designed to produce comparable data on patients' perspectives of care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between hospitals on domains that are important to consumers. Second, public reporting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care. Third, public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of hospital care provided in return for the public investment. With these goals in mind, the HCAHPS project has taken substantial steps to assure that the survey is credible, useful, and practical. This methodology and the information it generates is made available to the public. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always" responses on the "Communication with Doctors" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Hospital inpatients with an admission during the reporting period who answered the "Communication with Doctors" questions on the CAHPS Hospital Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).      Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction           Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)                The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Physician" section of the Inpatient Survey Patients with an inpatient admission during the reporting period who answered at least one question in the "Physician" section of the Inpatient Survey. All deceased patients and all neonates are excluded from sampling.
NQMC-845	This measure indicates adult patients' perceptions of the counseling or treatment they received.  Patients rate the counseling and treatment they received on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst counseling or treatment possible and 10 is the best counseling or treatment possible.  Responses are grouped by rating: percentages are reported for ratings of 9 and 10, 7 and 8, and 6 and lower.    Note: The percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 (or sometimes 8, 9, and 10) is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.  Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.  The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies. This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:        To satisfy external standards.       To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.       To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.       To hold providers accountable through public reporting.    To report ratings of 9 and 10:  The number of health plan members from the denominator who rated the counseling or treatment they received a 9 or 10    To report ratings of 7 and 8:  The number of health plan members from the denominator who rated the counseling or treatment they received a 7 or 8    To report ratings of 6 or lower:  The number of health plan members from the denominator who rated the counseling or treatment they received a 6 or lower   Health plan members age 18 years and older, enrolled in a managed care organization (MCO) or managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) for the previous 12 months with no more than one break in enrollment of up to 45 days during the enrollment period, who received behavioral health care services and who answered the "Overall Rating of Counseling and Treatment" question on the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey
NQMC-2045	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adolescent and adult patients who reported how often the staff and their providers kept their HIV status confidential.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Core Measures.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction    Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall. The number of patients who indicated "All of the time," "Most times," "Sometimes," "Rarely," "Never," or "Does not apply" to the item, "The staff and my providers kept my HIV status confidential." HIV positive adolescents and adults 13 years of age and older who had at least 2 HIV primary care visits in the last 12 months and completed the survey
NQMC-7462	This measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") provider's office staff were helpful and treated them with courtesy and respect.  This "Helpful, Courteous, and Respectful Office Staff" composite measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult 12-Month Survey that asks how often:        Clerks and receptionists helpful       Clerks and receptionists courteous and respectful     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The 12-month version of the CG-CAHPS asks patients to report on their experiences with a provider's officeboth the health care provider they see and the office staffover the last 12 months. This reference period of 12 months prompts respondents to consider multiple experiences with care when answering the questions. It is also consistent with the 12-month reference period for the commercial version of the Health Plan Survey. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" responses on the "Helpful, Courteous, and Respectful Office Staff" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "Helpful, Courteous, and Respectful Office Staff" questions on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult 12-Month Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-7488	This individual items measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients who reported how often their provider paid attention to care from other providers.   This "Attention to Care from Other Providers" measure is based on two questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Adult 12-Month Survey with Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Items:        In the last 12 months, how often did the provider named in Question 1 seem informed and up-to-date about the care you got from specialists? ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always")       In the last 12 months, did you and anyone in this provider's office talk at each visit about all the prescription medicines you were taking? ("Yes" or "No")     This survey combines the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey with the PCMH Item Set to address the domains of the medical home.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     To address interest in assessing patient experience with the patient-centered medical home model, the CAHPS Consortium has developed an extended version of the Clinician  Group 12-Month Survey that incorporates the CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Item Set. The item set expands on existing CG-CAHPS survey domains and adds questions in other domains to address key elements of the medical home model.  The PCMH is a model for delivering primary care that is patient-centered, comprehensive, coordinated, accessible, and continuously improved through a systems-based approach to quality and safety.  Primary care practices throughout the U.S. are implementing the medical home model. To evaluate the impact of implementing this model, health care organizations and public agencies are investigating how it affects the effectiveness, efficiency, and patient-centeredness of care. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" responses on the following "Attention to Care from Other Providers" question:        In the last 12 months, how often did the provider named in Question 1 seem informed and up-to-date about the care you got from specialists?     The number of "Yes" or "No" responses on the following "Attention to Care from Other Providers" question:        In the last 12 months, did you and anyone in this provider's office talk at each visit about all the prescription medicines you were taking?

NQMC-8618	The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Adult Version provides information on patients' experience with practices and gives a general indication of how well a practice meets patient expectations. Results summarize patient experience with care through an overall rating question, composites and question summary rates.   For this "Communication" measure, adult patients reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their provider communicated well. The "Communication" composite measure is based on six questions in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Adult Version:         Q19: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider explain things in a way that was easy to understand?       Q20: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider listen carefully to you?       Q22: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider give you easy to understand information about these health questions or concerns?       Q23: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider seem to know the important information about your medical history?       Q24: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider show respect for what you had to say?       Q25: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider spend enough time with you?   The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcomeand that experience is itself a measure of outcome. The number of "Never" or "Sometimes," "Usually," and "Always" responses on the "Communication" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Eligible patients who answered the "Communication" questions on the CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Adult Version (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-267	This measure assesses the mean score for the questions in the "Personal Issues" section of the Emergency Department Survey.    The "Personal Issues" section is one of eight sections that comprise the Emergency Department Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Healthcare employee satisfaction and retention           Healthcare facility competitive market strength           Hospital profitability           Risk management (likelihood of being sued)                The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Personal Issues" section of the Emergency Department Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Emergency Department Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details. Patients with an emergency department (ED) visit during the reporting period who answered at least one question in the "Personal Issues" section of the Emergency Department Survey. Deceased patients, patients admitted to hospital through the ED, patients who leave the ED against medical advice, patients who leave the ED without being seen, and patients transferred to another hospital/institution are not eligible.
NQMC-3049	This measure is used to assess adult in-center hemodialysis patients' perceptions of their dialysis center staff. Patients rate their dialysis center staff on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst dialysis center staff possible and 10 is the best dialysis center staff possible. Responses are grouped by rating: percentages are reported for either ratings of 9 and 10, 7 and 8, and 6 and lower OR ratings of 10, 8 and 9, and 7 and lower.    Note: The percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 (or sometimes 10) is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower OR 10, 8 and 9, and 7 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.As a result of legislation passed in 1972, Medicare pays for more than two-thirds of the expenditures for care for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To help ensure that these patients are receiving quality care, the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) has been reporting comparative clinical information at the facility level since January of 2001 on its Dialysis Facility Compare Web site. However, patient survey results are noticeably absent from the current set of quality measures for ESRD care. In recent years, both the U.S. Office of the Inspector General and MedPac's 2003 Report to Congress noted the need to evaluate the experience of care for ESRD patients.  Consequently, in late 2002, CMS requested that the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the CAHPS grantees produce a patient survey for in-center hemodialysis patients.  This request was part of CMS's broader quality agenda for its ESRD program.    The CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey is designed to assess the experiences of hemodialysis patients who receive care from dialysis facilities. It is intended to serve as a tool that both facilities and End-Stage Renal Disease Networks can use to measure and improve the patient-centeredness of their care. In-center hemodialysis patients' ratings of their dialysis center staff on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst dialysis center staff possible and 10 is the best dialysis center staff possible (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) In-center hemodialysis patients, age 18 years and older, who answered the "Rating of Dialysis Center Staff" question on the CAHPS In-Center Hemodialysis Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-8960	This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients who reported if the provider's use of computers during their visit was useful.  The "Helpfulness of Provider's Use of a Computer or Handheld Device" composite measure is based on two questions from the CAHPS Health Information Technology (Health IT) Item Set consisting of supplemental items designed for use with the CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey. The two questions ask whether:        Provider's use of computer or handheld device was helpful to patient ("Yes, definitely," "Yes, somewhat," or "No")       Provider's use of computer or handheld device made it harder or easier to talk with him or her ("Harder," "Not harder or easier," or "Easier")     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Health Information Technology (Health IT) Item Set is designed for use with the CG-CAHPS to assess a variety of aspects of health IT.  This item set is intended to collect data that health care providers can use to improve care by:        Identifying specific topic areas for quality improvement.       Recognizing particular behaviors or actions that inhibit the effective use of health IT.       Measuring the effect of behaviors that promote the effective use of health IT.     There are many local, regional, and national initiatives to accelerate the adoption of health IT. Because of the associated changes in the delivery of care, assessing the use of health IT from the patient's perspective is important.  While the technology has the potential to improve communication and access for patients, some studies have reported negative outcomes, such as depersonalization of the provider visit. The CAHPS Consortium developed items that would assess aspects of the use of health IT for which patients are the best or only source of information. The number of "Yes, definitely," "Yes, somewhat," or "No" responses on the "Helpfulness of Provider's Use of a Computer or Handheld Device" question and "Harder," "Not harder or easier," or "Easier" responses on the "Made it Easier or Harder to Talk" question (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "Helpfulness of Provider's Use of Computers During a Visit" questions from the Health Information Technology Item Set on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-7467	This composite measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who reported if ("Yes, definitely," "Yes, somewhat," or "No") their provider's office staff were helpful and treated them with courtesy and respect.

Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Visit Survey asks patients to report on their experiences with providers and office staff at their most recent visit to a provider's office. This instrument addresses feedback from many users regarding the need for a CAHPS survey that focuses on experiences during a single visit rather than over a period of time. More targeted feedback about a visit can provide medical practices with valuable information for monitoring and improvement. Also, many physicians are accustomed to seeing survey results for a visit, which they sometimes perceive as more valid and credible.

Results summarize patient experience with care through an overall rating question, composites and question summary rates.   For this "Comprehensiveness - Adult Behavioral" measure, adult patients reported whether ("Yes" or "No") they received comprehensive behavioral healthcare. The "Comprehensiveness - Adult Behavioral" composite measure is based on three questions in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Adult Version:        Q39: In the last 12 months, did anyone in this provider's office ask you if there was a period of time when you felt sad, empty or depressed?       Q40: In the last 12 months, did you and anyone in this provider's office talk about things in your life that worry you or cause you stress?

NQMC-7245	This measure is used to assess the mean scale score on the "Relationship with the Doctors" domain on the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Patient Questionnaire.  A mean scale score is calculated based on patients' ratings (1 = "Not at All Satisfied"; 2 = "Not Very Satisfied"; 3 = "Somewhat Satisfied"; 4 = "Very Satisfied"; 5 = "Completely Satisfied") on the following questions:        How satisfied are you that you knew the doctor(s) in charge of your care during the past month?       How satisfied are you that your doctor(s) took a personal interest in you during the past month?       How satisfied are you that your doctor(s) were available when you needed them (by phone or in person) during the past month?       How satisfied are you with the level of trust and confidence you had in the doctor(s) who looked after you during the past month?     Note: The "Relationship with the Doctors" domain is one of six domains comprising the CANHELP Patient Questionnaire. Mean scale scores are calculated for each domain of the questionnaire. In addition, an "Overall" satisfaction score is calculated. Please note that there is another version of the surveyCANHELP Liteavailable from the CARENET Web site.Initiatives to improve satisfaction with end-of-life (EOL) care remain hampered by a nascent understanding of what quality care means to patients and their families, and how it is best measured. Several experts and professional societies have attempted to define the specific components and related areas (domains) involved in quality EOL care; in contrast, patient and family perspectives are surprisingly lacking.   Most previous studies of quality have focused on outpatients and people with cancer. Researchers recently documented that most Canadians (greater than 70%) die in hospitals, and the majority of decedents are elderly patients who died from causes unrelated to cancer. The trajectory of a patient dying from cancer differs from one dying from other, chronic, end-stage medical conditions. Thus, issues deemed important to quality EOL care that were identified by previous investigators may not be generalizable to seriously ill patients with advanced disease other than cancer, who have a more uncertain prognosis.   Although a "quality death" is an espoused right of Canadians, for many dying patients and their families it is not achieved. Recent reviews and observational studies describe considerable dissatisfaction with EOL care, indicating that there are still opportunities for improvement. Ideally, initiatives aimed at improving EOL care would be informed by the experiences and expectations of patients and their family members. However, such efforts are often hampered by inadequate definitions of quality of care and by suboptimal tools for measurement.   In a recent review, few studies evaluated satisfaction with care at the EOL, and most used non-validated assessment tools. To advance this field, standardized, validated satisfaction questionnaires are needed to measure meaningful outcomes in order to evaluate the effects of various clinical, organizational, policy, and financial initiatives that influence how EOL care is delivered and experienced. By first understanding patients' and families' levels of satisfaction with key elements of EOL care, we will be in a better position to improve their individual care, and to introduce quality improvement initiatives to the health care system as needed.   The Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire was designed to help researchers, health care providers, patients, and their families better understand satisfaction with care provided to seriously ill patients with advanced disease and to identify opportunities for improvement.

NQMC-5033	This "Side Effects" scale* on the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) is used to assess the level of dissatisfaction with the "Side Effects" of medication patients are taking. This composite scale is comprised of three of four items on the TSQM survey:        As a result of taking this medication, do you experience any side effects at all? (y/n dichotomous skip)       How dissatisfied are you by side effects that interfere with your physical health and ability to function (e.g., strength, energy levels)?       How dissatisfied are you by side effects that interfere with your mental function (e.g., ability to think clearly, stay awake)?       How dissatisfied are you by side effects that interfere with your mood or emotions (e.g., anxiety/fear, sadness, irritation/anger)?     *Note: The validity of this scale is influenced by the degree to which patients can; a) use personal experience to assess the effectiveness of their medication, b) has information on the clinical effectiveness of their medication (e.g., clinician appraisal, lab results etc.) and c) has formulated perceptions/beliefs about its effectiveness. Of note, patients' satisfaction and medication behavior may be the result of erroneous beliefs about the effectiveness of their medication. Moreover, medications may take time before they begin to work and TSQM assessments should be made after patients have had a chance to fully evaluate their medication.  Note: The "Side Effects" scale is a component of a composite measure. It cannot be used on its own and must be used with the following scales:        "Effectiveness" scale of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM): the mean scale score for the "Effectiveness" items on the TSQM (version II).       "Convenience" scale of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM): the mean scale score for the "Convenience" items on the TSQM (version II).       "Global Satisfaction" scale of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM): the mean scale score for the "Global Satisfaction" items on the TSQM (version II).   Patients' dissatisfaction with treatment may act as an early indicator of non-adherence and non-persistence with medication use, thereby affecting the clinical effectiveness and efficiency of medical care. Patients who perceive their medication to be ineffective (see the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summary, "Effectiveness" scale of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM): the mean scale score for the "Effectiveness" items on the TSQM (version II)), laden with side effects, very inconvenient (see the related NQMC summary, "Convenience" scale of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM): the mean scale score for the "Convenience" items on the TSQM (version II)), or as having more negative than positive characteristics (see the related NQMC summary, "Global Satisfaction" scale of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM): the mean scale score for the "Global Satisfaction" items on the TSQM (version II)) are less likely to either fill prescriptions or take their medications as prescribed. This in turn can impact the effectiveness of treatments and may result in service inefficiencies associated with treatment failure.  Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) provides a unique opportunity to compare various medications used to treat a particular condition. Routine assessment of patients' level of TS-M provides a way for clinicians to screen individuals whose current medication experiences may increase the risk of poor medication adherence and weak persistence. If collected from many patients, such information can foster a deeper understanding of patients' perspectives when evaluating the merits and drawbacks of various treatment alternatives.

NQMC-3902	This measure is used to assess the mean score for the questions in the "Personal Issues" section of the Home Health Care Survey.    The "Personal Issues" section is one of five sections that comprise the Home Health Care Survey. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Healthcare employee satisfaction and retention           Healthcare facility competitive market strength           Hospital profitability           Risk management (likelihood of being sued)                The mean of all the patients' scores for the "Personal Issues" section of the Home Health Care Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Home Health Care Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details.

NQMC-4939	This measure, the Bereaved Family Survey (BFS), is used to assess families' (surrogates) perceptions of the care that is provided to veterans who die in an inpatient Veterans Affairs (VA) facility (intensive care, acute care, hospice unit, nursing home care unit or community living center).A growing body of research has underscored the degree to which end-of-life care in the United States needs to be improved. The challenges of end-of-life care are particularly significant in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system because the VA provides care for an increasingly older population with multiple comorbid conditions. In FY2000, approximately 104,000 enrolled veterans died in the U.S., and approximately 27,200 veterans died in VA facilities. At least 30% of veterans are over age 65 now, and 46% will be over 65 by 2030. Therefore, it is clear that the number of deaths in VA facilities will increase substantially as the World War II and Korean War veterans age. These demographic trends mean that, like other healthcare systems, the VA will face substantial challenges of providing care to veterans near the end of life.  The VA has addressed this challenge aggressively in the last 5 years; however, the VA had not yet developed and implemented measures of the quality of end-of-life care it provides to veterans. There are at least 3 reasons why adoption of a quality measurement tool is essential. First, it would make it possible to define and compare the quality of end-of-life care at each VA facility and to identify opportunities for improvement. Second, facilities and Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) (geographic service divisions within the VA system) would be able to monitor the effectiveness of efforts to improve care locally and nationally, and would enable monitoring of the impact of the Comprehensive End of Life Care Initiative, ensuring that expenditures are producing improvements in care. Third, it will help the VA to recognize those facilities that provide outstanding end-of-life care, so that successful processes and structures of care can be identified and disseminated throughout the VA. Proportion of responses that received the optimal rating among completed surveys for the global item Veterans who die in an inpatient Veterans Affairs (VA) facility (intensive care, acute care, hospice unit, nursing home care unit, or community living center) for whom a survey is completed (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)

NQMC-5229	This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult dental plan patients who indicated how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") they had a good experience with different aspects of care from dentists and staff. This measure summarizes answers to survey questions that asked people how often:        Their regular dentist explained things in a way that was easy to understand.       Their regular dentist listened carefully to them.       Their regular dentist treated them with courtesy and respect.       Their regular dentist spent enough time with them.       The dentists or dental staff did everything they could to help them feel as comfortable as possible during their dental work.       The dentists or dental staff explained what they were doing while treating them.     The "Care from Dentists and Staff" composite measure is based on six questions in the CAHPS Dental Plan Survey.  Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. Additionally, frequency distributions are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.Patient satisfaction is a common subject in the dental literature, and this partly seems to result from the unique nature of dental care. Patients tend to suffer from a fair amount of anxiety related to dental care - most notably with respect to the pain and discomfort associated (at least subjectively) with many dental procedures. One survey in Kentucky found that 40% of the population reported dental fear, with 17% reporting high dental fear. In that same study, 52% of the population were of the opinion that "pain" was the main reason that people were afraid of the dentist.  The literature also shows that the level of distress, anxiety, or fear appear to influence patients' evaluations of dentists' behaviors and patients' satisfaction with care. Level of anxiety has even been shown to influence the kind of communication style preferred by the patient.  Pain itself is an important dimension of the dental patient experience, and it has been shown to influence care-seeking and compliance with treatment, increase feelings of helplessness, and predict patterns of health service utilization; patients' descriptions of pain can influence clinical judgments and treatment decisions (e.g., how much pain relief is offered to the patient). Patients view pain as a "discrete assessable component" of dental treatment.  Communication has been shown to be a significant influence on patient satisfaction. Several studies emphasize the importance of dentist-patient interaction during the dental encounter - especially in terms of what has been labeled "communicative involvement" in one study. Communicatively involved dentists appear attentive, perceptive, and responsive to patients' comments and needs; they establish rapport, discuss treatment plans and options, and help elaborate and confirm the patient's understanding of their treatment encounter. This kind of open, interactive communication has been shown to improve the patient's overall satisfaction with their dental provider.  In addition, it has been generally shown that a dentist's "chairside manner" significantly influences dental care outcomes such as patients' satisfaction, anxiety, and willingness to return for further treatment. Patients who receive incomplete, general, or impersonal information regarding their condition of treatment tend to perceive their dentist as hostile. This desire for information reflects the desire patients have to play a collaborative role in decision-making regarding their dental care, although many perceive that they play a passive role in treatment decisions. In some cases, however, some patients (e.g., those who suffer from particularly high anxiety) do show a preference for interaction marked by "communicative dominance" on the practitioner's part, which refers to the extent to which the dentist controls the nature and topics of the encounter.  Another dimension is satisfaction with the results of dental treatment. This dimension is to some extent concentrated in the specialty area of prosthodontics - the sub-field that deals with the restoration and replacement of teeth (e.g., fitting of dentures, implants, and bridges) - although these satisfaction concerns do span other areas of dentistry. This dimension includes basic (improvement in) comfort experienced by the patient as a result of dental work, the functionality of prosthodontic dental work (e.g., in eating or chewing, or phonetics), as well as the overall appearance, or aesthetics, of prosthodontics. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always" responses on the "Care from Dentists and Staff" questions    From the responses, a composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality.

NQMC-852	This single-item measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who reported whether ("Yes" or "No") they felt they could refuse a specific type of medicine or treatment.Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.  The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies. This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:        To satisfy external standards.       To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.       To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.       To hold providers accountable through public reporting.

NQMC-6442	This measure is used to assess the percentage of surgical patients who indicated whether ("Yes, definitely", "Yes, somewhat", or "No") their surgeon or a health provider from this surgeon's office gave them information to help them recover from surgery.  The "Information to Help You Recover from Surgery" composite measure is based on four questions in the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey that asks patients whether their surgeon or a health provider from their surgeon's office:        Explained what to expect during recovery       Warned them about symptoms that need immediate attention       Gave easy to understand instructions about what to do during recovery       Made sure they were physically comfortable or had enough pain relief after leaving the hospital or surgery facility     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Surgical Care Survey addresses the need to assess and improve the experiences of surgical patients. Like other CAHPS surveys, this questionnaire focuses on aspects of surgical quality that are important to patients and for which patients are the best source of information. The survey results are expected to be useful to everyone with a need for information on the quality of surgeons and surgical care, including patients, practice groups, health plans, insurers, and specialty boards.  The Surgical Care Survey expands on the current CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey, which focuses on primary and specialty care, by incorporating domains that are relevant to surgical care, such as informed consent, anesthesia care, and post-operative follow-up. The survey is unique among CAHPS surveys in that it assesses patients' experiences with surgical care in both the inpatient and outpatient settings by asking respondents about their care before, during, and after surgery. The number of respondents from the denominator who indicated "Yes, definitely", "Yes, somewhat", or "No" responses on the "Information to Help You Recover from Surgery" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Patients age 18 years and older who had a surgery performed during the reporting period and who answered the "Information to Help You Recover from Surgery" questions on the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-2135	This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adult patients who reported whether overall, they were satisfied with this Medicaid managed care plan during the past 12 months.    This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Medicaid Managed Care module.Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:      Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers  Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment  Keeping appointments    Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.    Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:      Strengthen communication and build relations with patients  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective  Focus the quality improvement efforts  Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction     Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall. The number of patients who indicated "Strongly Disagree," "Disagree," "Agree," or "Strongly Agree" to the item, "Overall, I was satisfied with this Medicaid managed care plan during the past 12 months."

NQMC-7470	This measure is used to assess the percentage of parents/guardians (respondents) who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") they were able to get timely appointments, needed care, and information for their child.   This "Getting Timely Appointments, Care, and Information" composite measure is based on five questions in the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child 12-Month Survey that asks how often:        Child got appointment for urgent care as soon as needed       Child got appointment for non-urgent care as soon as needed       Respondent got answer to medical question the same day he/she phoned provider's office       Respondent got answer to medical question as soon as he/she needed when phoned provider's office after hours       Child saw provider within 15 minutes of appointment time     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The 12-month version of the CG-CAHPS asks patients to report on their experiences with a provider's officeboth the health care provider they see and the office staffover the last 12 months. This reference period of 12 months prompts respondents to consider multiple experiences with care when answering the questions. It is also consistent with the 12-month reference period for the commercial version of the Health Plan Survey. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" responses on the "Getting Timely Appointments, Care, and Information" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All parents/guardians who answered the "Getting Timely Appointments, Care, and Information" questions on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Child 12-Month Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-4545	This measure is used to assess parents' or guardians' perceptions of their child's personal doctor. Parents rate their child's personal doctor on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst personal doctor possible and 10 is the best personal doctor possible. Responses are grouped by rating: percentages are reported for ratings of 9 and 10, 7 and 8, and 6 and lower.    Note: The percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 (or sometimes 8, 9, and 10) is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (then called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) initiated the CAHPS program in October 1995 to develop standardized survey tools for obtaining and reporting information on consumers' experiences with health care. The CAHPS consortium began by developing the CAHPS Health Plan Survey, an integrated set of carefully tested and standardized questionnaires and report formats that can be used to produce meaningful, reliable, and comparable information about the experiences of consumers enrolled in health plans.    The CAHPS Health Plan Survey is designed to generate information that consumers can use to choose health plans, that purchasers can use to assess the value of services they buy, and that health plans can use to assess their performance and improve their products and services. As AHRQ had intended, the survey can be used with all types of health insurance consumers--including Medicaid recipients, Medicare beneficiaries, and those who are commercially insured--and across the full range of health care delivery systems, from fee-for-service to managed care plans. The instruments also capture information about special groups, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities and families with children.    The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires health plans to submit measures from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey as part of their HEDIS submission and for accreditation purposes. Parents' or guardians' ratings of their child's personal doctor on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst personal doctor possible and 10 is the best personal doctor possible (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) Health plan members age 17 years and younger whose parent or guardian answered the "Rating of Personal Doctor" question on the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 4.0 (Child Questionnaire) (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
NQMC-2245	This measure is used to assess the mean score for the questions in the "Your Child's Physician" section of the Inpatient Pediatric Survey.    The "Your Child's Physician" section is one of ten sections that comprise the Inpatient Pediatric Survey.  Mean section scores are reported for each section of this survey.  In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.      Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.      In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that      "...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care, Health Administration Press).       It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).      Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).            In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:                Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction           Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)                The mean of all the parents' scores for the questions from the "Your Child's Physician" section of the Inpatient Pediatric Survey    Refer to the "Press Ganey's Inpatient Pediatric Survey: Calculation of Scores Information" document listed in the "Companion Documents" field for additional details. Parents of patients with an inpatient pediatric care admission discharged during the reporting period who answered at least one question in the "Your Child's Physician" section of the Inpatient Pediatric Survey.  All deceased patients and newborns are excluded from sampling.  
NQMC-8961	This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients who reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their provider's Web site was helpful in giving information about their care and tests.  This "Helpfulness of Provider's Web Site in Giving You Information About Your Care and Tests" composite measure is based on four questions from the CAHPS Health Information Technology (Health IT) Item Set consisting of supplemental items designed for use with the CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys. The four questions ask how often:        Easy-to-find lab or other test results on the Web site       Lab or other test results posted on Web site as soon as you needed them       Lab or other test results presented in a way that was easy to understand       Visit notes were easy to understand     Note: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.The CAHPS Clinician  Group Surveys (CG-CAHPS) assess patients' experiences with health care providers and staff in providers' offices. Survey results can be used to:        Improve care provided by individual providers, sites of care, medical groups, or provider networks.       Equip consumers with information they can use to choose physicians and other health care providers, physician practices, or medical groups.     The Health Information Technology (Health IT) Item Set is designed for use with the CG-CAHPS to assess a variety of aspects of health IT.  This item set is intended to collect data that health care providers can use to improve care by:        Identifying specific topic areas for quality improvement.       Recognizing particular behaviors or actions that inhibit the effective use of health IT.       Measuring the effect of behaviors that promote the effective use of health IT.     There are many local, regional, and national initiatives to accelerate the adoption of health IT. Because of the associated changes in the delivery of care, assessing the use of health IT from the patient's perspective is important.  While the technology has the potential to improve communication and access for patients, some studies have reported negative outcomes, such as depersonalization of the provider visit. The CAHPS Consortium developed items that would assess aspects of the use of health IT for which patients are the best or only source of information. The number of "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always" responses on the "Helpfulness of Provider's Web Site in Giving You Information About Your Care and Tests" questions (see the related "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field) All patients who answered the "Helpfulness of Provider's Web Site in Giving You Information About Your Care and Tests" from the Health Information Technology Item Set on the CAHPS Clinician  Group Survey (see the related "Denominator Inclusions/Exclusions" field)
